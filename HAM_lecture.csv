I just want to just quickly say that I had the opportunity of meeting in Andrade after a group show we were in together at in Philadelphia at the Locks Gallery and the opportunity to meet her with the dinner afterwards. And it was a great opportunity and I remember that we sat next to each other in the restaurant. She was really just a very, I can say, just her spirit was extremely generous and she gave me space. And I didn't know, I knew of her work before meeting her but not as much as I do now. And what I was impressed with is that she gave me space and this is an artist who is very, very important, very profound. And I think we're going to learn a lot more about her and the world is going to learn a lot more about her with shows like this. But as I looked at her syllabi and different student coursework that she put together and looked at that research, I saw the mind of a genius and a great mind, a huge mind. And someone who was really able to utilize teaching as a means of growing her work and of building the work through the help of her students and the students would learn it along the way. But to look at that resource material, that source materials to know how intensely intelligent and ambitious this artist is. And so I want to preface my talk with this information to say that the ways in which artists can bring their information, their story, their history to the practice is very profound and never really seen by the audience. They just see the finished thing and they can make their judgments and statements from that. But it's really very important to understand all those little things and big things that come into making. And you definitely see in that room that room is packed. It's like a box that's like pressed. So I would have present some images real quick for you guys to speak about my own process and just to say that I feel just moved by her sense of generosity and the fact that she gave me that space that evening and a person who could have consumed all the space that evening was that was that kind. So this is worked on specifically focusing on from a period of 20 to 2021 through to the present. I'm a painter. My practice has evolved over the years where I'm looking at space color and I'm thinking about my experience and my upbringing as an African and Nigerian. And these paintings really started from when I started to understand fully understood what I wanted to do. I wanted to create a space that would be that would exist before language. And that was my situational understanding of that was because I watched a lot of TV as a kid that space before the image became clear, that test band pattern space before. This doesn't kids today don't have this but this this test band pattern that's exploded the screen right before you saw an image which is in my mind language. So that space is really important for me as a as an African as a black person in this world because as I say as an African and as a black person in this world I'm defining myself and then you can have your constructs that you place on top of me because I just said those things. But this is the world we live in so I was wanting to unknowing at the time the space before language where essentially it's it's another idea of freedom or freedom is very open but another space to understand or maybe experienced freedom. So in this case in this work this was a piece called walls of change made at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was a piece that was coming out of the pandemic and political climate and this is the installation process of putting that piece together. And I'm sharing these resource images similar to what we see upstairs with the kind of of research that Edna is putting together in her in her production. This was what I was inspired by the walls of change being the museum walls. The museum was basically acted as a backdrop for all this activity in the city during this time all these different protests all these different actions. And for me the formations of people in this space were my way of understanding the formations of the space in which I used for my painting for my installation. Looking at how people are organizing themselves how movement is occurring and what's going on and it's just to say that source material can come from anything and from anywhere and this is what was my particular motivation for this work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It's very interesting in ways in which things change and things stay the same. And to see this at this time and to think that this was of that time and to know what we're going through now is to see that things can continue and struggle continues and that was part of the element of that work as well. This is a piece called Surrounding that's at the University of Iowa Stanley Museum of Art. This piece inaugurated the museum's renovations and it was up in conjunction with the Jackson Pollock painting mural that was brought back to its home there. This is a special place for me as well because my parents went to school here as graduate students. My father studied printmaking and painting before going to Indiana University to study with Roy Seiber, the first Africanist in America to become an art historian there. So Surrounding is really coming from a collection of my sensibility, my sensing color and my sensing space and just extrapolating from my experience there. This is a piece I did at the Dallas Cowboys Stadium, the AT&T Stadium. This is a different kind of client. I wanted to show this in conjunction with the art institutional work because when I'm working and doing these installations there's a different person that's coming to ask me to do these things and it's a different kind of experience from the other. This is the completed work at this time. I was asked to do two sides of the stadium. There was a little apprehension with the use of my color. So they decided to only do one side of the stadium and they love this but I'm still waiting for them to possibly ask me to do the other side of the stadium. There's also a very interesting thing that happened here. We don't have time for the story but I just wanted to mention that. These are the different sequences. I'm very interested in ways that art can work in spaces and it's very different from the idea of thinking of the white cube or a gallery space work functions in a way that you have a bench, you have space and whatnot. I like the way in which art work can activate a space, become active and activate the audience in different ways. It's not to say that it's a problem because there's an obstacle in front of it but how does the work engage the space and allow you to become more aware of what you're doing as you're there. This edge is very important to me because it objectifies the painting and makes it like a thing in the middle of this space that is a thing as well. This is a wall I did at Astor Park in Columbus, Ohio for the Columbus Cruise Stadium, the soccer team there, the pieces called Interplay. I was thinking about the colors of the team, yellow and black and the space between white and black as let's say the extremes of value. That was a certain kind of aesthetic concern that allowed me to ultimately realize this particular piece. It was really quite difficult because when I'm thinking of color, color is not something that's just random and randomly selected. Actually, this is actually a very difficult thing because I had to think of a color range between yellow and black that could exist and be reasonably felt and understood between yellow and black. It was just really daunting and it took me a while to get to it but I think it worked out. Also, I wanted to think about the way in which this activity of soccer, the field challenge in sport came into the design of the work. This is the last series of images showing the digital renderings of the installation. I was in a conversation with the museum essentially two years before we actually implemented the work and it took me again a while to make these drawings, collect the drawings together. Once they were approved, in my sense, I approved them, I showed them to curator, then I redrew everything again to really finalize it for us to be able to do this work. Then there's another layer of work which I'm not showing that goes to my assistants that put that up on the wall. This is a sense of the client has to come in because these are expensive. They have to actually understand what you're doing. I think it's really great to actually see these things because we get a sense of what in a way in which the artist in the studio has to learn through that time. I can learn through this time what the work is going to do and how it's going to move and function. But there was a lot of hours of drawing and then color selection before we get to this initial space here which is now the physical space in the museum. The wall that's overhanging was really a stressful wall because we could only do that at night after the museum closed with the scissor lift. Because the timeframe of when we had to do it, this is a museum that is an organic entity that never sleeps. It's always functioning and doing something so there were many days in which we couldn't work at all because they were dedicated to other schedule events. But if we miss painted any of these shapes, we would have lost days and which would have put us out of schedule because we needed to fix the entire space within a given time. But it was really great to have the installation during the day with the audience there because they interacted, they loved it. And that's very important part of this project as well where people get to see a painting made in front of them. They get basically being in the artist studio but the artist studio is in the public space. And then this is the last piece just called Skyway. I completed an installation which is not here because I did it in 2019, 2020 at the Penn Medicine Pavilion which is now called the Clifton Center. This is again a digital rendering, not a rhino model but a digital rendering of my drawing filled with color. The colors I selected for this I was thinking of the hospital and the ways in which I wanted to open up essentially a new window in this really tight hallway space and bring a different kind of light to that hospital. So this is the finished piece, the day it was finished with the Cicerolyphs still there but it's up now. And if you were to visit, well on good terms if you're ever to visit this hospital, you would see that it's part of another section of the hospital where there are two different installations going up the escalator and down another hallway. And so this is the third installment. Thank you.","https://www.moma.org/magazine/articles/1230, https://bombmagazine.org/articles/2020/12/01/an-oral-history-with-odili-donald-odita-by-ugochukwu-smooth-c-nzewi/"

So I would have present some images real quick for you guys to speak about my own process and just to say that I feel just moved by her sense of generosity and the fact that she gave me that space that evening and a person who could have consumed all the space that evening was that was that kind. So this is worked on specifically focusing on from a period of 20 to 2021 through to the present. I'm a painter. My practice has evolved over the years where I'm looking at space color and I'm thinking about my experience and my upbringing as an African and Nigerian. And these paintings really started from when I started to understand fully understood what I wanted to do. I wanted to create a space that would be that would exist before language. And that was my situational understanding of that was because I watched a lot of TV as a kid that space before the image became clear, that test band pattern space before. This doesn't kids today don't have this but this this test band pattern that's exploded the screen right before you saw an image which is in my mind language. So that space is really important for me as a as an African as a black person in this world because as I say as an African and as a black person in this world I'm defining myself and then you can have your constructs that you place on top of me because I just said those things. But this is the world we live in so I was wanting to unknowing at the time the space before language where essentially it's it's another idea of freedom or freedom is very open but another space to understand or maybe experienced freedom. So in this case in this work this was a piece called walls of change made at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It was a piece that was coming out of the pandemic and political climate and this is the installation process of putting that piece together. And I'm sharing these resource images similar to what we see upstairs with the kind of of research that Edna is putting together in her in her production. This was what I was inspired by the walls of change being the museum walls. The museum was basically acted as a backdrop for all this activity in the city during this time all these different protests all these different actions. And for me the formations of people in this space were my way of understanding the formations of the space in which I used for my painting for my installation. Looking at how people are organizing themselves how movement is occurring and what's going on and it's just to say that source material can come from anything and from anywhere and this is what was my particular motivation for this work at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It's very interesting in ways in which things change and things stay the same. And to see this at this time and to think that this was of that time and to know what we're going through now is to see that things can continue and struggle continues and that was part of the element of that work as well. This is a piece called Surrounding that's at the University of Iowa Stanley Museum of Art. This piece inaugurated the museum's renovations and it was up in conjunction with the Jackson Pollock painting mural that was brought back to its home there. This is a special place for me as well because my parents went to school here as graduate students. My father studied printmaking and painting before going to Indiana University to study with Roy Seiber, the first Africanist in America to become an art historian there. So Surrounding is really coming from a collection of my sensibility, my sensing color and my sensing space and just extrapolating from my experience there. This is a piece I did at the Dallas Cowboys Stadium, the AT&T Stadium. This is a different kind of client. I wanted to show this in conjunction with the art institutional work because when I'm working and doing these installations there's a different person that's coming to ask me to do these things and it's a different kind of experience from the other. This is the completed work at this time. I was asked to do two sides of the stadium. There was a little apprehension with the use of my color. So they decided to only do one side of the stadium and they love this but I'm still waiting for them to possibly ask me to do the other side of the stadium. There's also a very interesting thing that happened here. We don't have time for the story but I just wanted to mention that. These are the different sequences. I'm very interested in ways that art can work in spaces and it's very different from the idea of thinking of the white cube or a gallery space work functions in a way that you have a bench, you have space and whatnot. I like the way in which art work can activate a space, become active and activate the audience in different ways. It's not to say that it's a problem because there's an obstacle in front of it but how does the work engage the space and allow you to become more aware of what you're doing as you're there. This edge is very important to me because it objectifies the painting and makes it like a thing in the middle of this space that is a thing as well. This is a wall I did at Astor Park in Columbus, Ohio for the Columbus Cruise Stadium, the soccer team there, the pieces called Interplay. I was thinking about the colors of the team, yellow and black and the space between white and black as let's say the extremes of value. That was a certain kind of aesthetic concern that allowed me to ultimately realize this particular piece. It was really quite difficult because when I'm thinking of color, color is not something that's just random and randomly selected. Actually, this is actually a very difficult thing because I had to think of a color range between yellow and black that could exist and be reasonably felt and understood between yellow and black. It was just really daunting and it took me a while to get to it but I think it worked out. Also, I wanted to think about the way in which this activity of soccer, the field challenge in sport came into the design of the work. This is the last series of images showing the digital renderings of the installation. I was in a conversation with the museum essentially two years before we actually implemented the work and it took me again a while to make these drawings, collect the drawings together. Once they were approved, in my sense, I approved them, I showed them to curator, then I redrew everything again to really finalize it for us to be able to do this work. Then there's another layer of work which I'm not showing that goes to my assistants that put that up on the wall. This is a sense of the client has to come in because these are expensive. They have to actually understand what you're doing. I think it's really great to actually see these things because we get a sense of what in a way in which the artist in the studio has to learn through that time. I can learn through this time what the work is going to do and how it's going to move and function. But there was a lot of hours of drawing and then color selection before we get to this initial space here which is now the physical space in the museum. The wall that's overhanging was really a stressful wall because we could only do that at night after the museum closed with the scissor lift. Because the timeframe of when we had to do it, this is a museum that is an organic entity that never sleeps. It's always functioning and doing something so there were many days in which we couldn't work at all because they were dedicated to other schedule events. But if we miss painted any of these shapes, we would have lost days and which would have put us out of schedule because we needed to fix the entire space within a given time. But it was really great to have the installation during the day with the audience there because they interacted, they loved it. And that's very important part of this project as well where people get to see a painting made in front of them. They get basically being in the artist studio but the artist studio is in the public space. And then this is the last piece just called Skyway. I completed an installation which is not here because I did it in 2019, 2020 at the Penn Medicine Pavilion which is now called the Clifton Center. This is again a digital rendering, not a rhino model but a digital rendering of my drawing filled with color. The colors I selected for this I was thinking of the hospital and the ways in which I wanted to open up essentially a new window in this really tight hallway space and bring a different kind of light to that hospital. So this is the finished piece, the day it was finished with the Cicerolyphs still there but it's up now. And if you were to visit, well on good terms if you're ever to visit this hospital, you would see that it's part of another section of the hospital where there are two different installations going up the escalator and down another hallway. And so this is the third installment. Thank you.",

One of the most fulfilling parts and privileges of this career is being surrounded by creative minds engaged in thinking, discussion, and those who are committed to a lifetime of continual learning and growth. A sense of this spirit, the idea of artworks that were themselves exercises in looking and thinking is what first drew me to the art of Edna Andrade. Over the years that we have spent over the years that we have spent thumbing through her archives and studio files and of talking with the many members of the Philadelphia Arts community who were her students, who knew her through the city's arts institutions, and who admired the way her presence and practice gave them an anchor in its arts community. I have come to admire that Edna's greatest legacy may have been the way that she brought that energy of learning into all her relationships. The QR code on the screen is also on the opening panel of the exhibition text, and from it you can link to excerpts of Andrade's oral history with the archives of an American art, video clips of the artist at work in her studio, and the voices of the artists and museum professionals or a few who were shaped by their encounters with her and who as a group span generations. Tonight's program is not about Edna Andrade, but we developed it guided by her spirit. From her earliest days Edna pictured herself as an artist. She was fiercely committed to her artistic practice to building a career as an independent artist and to lifelong learning through conversation, community, and thinking across both cultural and disciplinary ways of learning. Before we begin this conversation, I want to offer a very brief introduction to the artist whose work has inspired this gathering. Born Edna Wright in 1917 in Port Smith, Virginia to a middle-class family who encouraged her interest in the arts. In 1934 she would enroll at the University of Pennsylvania to pursue a formal education in the arts. There she also completed her postgraduate studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 1938. Her education was about drawing from observation, a traditional academic training, creating convincingly faithful renderings of the life models as we see in this student drawing or student exercise on the left. And it's this interest, this practice of looking closely and drawing from observation, is a skill that she would continue into her middle age and beyond. From there, from after graduating, she began her first position as an educator, moving to New Orleans where she would teach visual arts at Newcombe College, the women's coordinate of Tulane University. Shortly after her arrival, the department would welcome a new chair, Robin Field, who arrived from his studies at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, and would transform the curriculum by introducing the lessons of the Bauhaus Foundation's course. From there on out, Andrade would think of art as well as her pedagogy as a process of inquiry, and the student exercise from one of Robin Field's foundations classes at Newcombe College, that he later donated to the Bush Risinger Museum, and is part of the Harvard Art Museum collections, and on the right, one of Andrade's studies in color and formed, inspired by one of her great Bauhaus influences, Joseph Albers. In 1941, when she returned to Philadelphia, where she would remain for the remainder of her career and life, she would apply her study of geometric compositions to designs for works for public and commercial arts commissions. And by the late 1950s, indeed, she had returned to the classroom and would remain an educator for the next four plus decades, influencing generations of artists in the Philadelphia Arts communities. An influential intellectual community that informed her work in these years was the group Form Forum, you see a flyer of theirs on the far right. This interdisciplinary slion convened artists, architects, scientists, and engineers to share their scholarship, believing firmly that they would learn that their studies in these various fields would inform one another. Modelled after the Harvard MIT filamorfs, this group, the Form Forum, also hosted guests from Cambridge, and we, in fact, have a flyer of the, for the guest lecture, when Arthur Loeb was the guest lecturer. Another bridge between Edna and Harvard, though she never was herself, a scholar here, was her close friendship with Anne Ting. Ting was one of the first female graduates of the Harvard's Graduate School of Design, and a part of the Philadelphia's Form Forum. Ting's study of space frames structures would become fundamental to her architectural practice, and we see it here across the ceiling expanse of Yale University's art gallery. A structure that would give new inspiration to how Edna approached the drawing of deep space, or illusionistic space, within her line drawings, and that would inform how she would place these geometries into built space in her public commissions, and here we see a marble mosaic piece at the Philadelphia free library that uses that same structural form. Whether the facets of a crystal or the branching patterns of a tree, Edna's compositions, the foundation of Edna's compositions was always, however, a study of the natural world. Geometry was, for Edna, a mathematics of describing systems in nature, and from her student days forward, she would love to travel, and as she travel, find different geometries in cultural context distant from her own. One of my very favorite drawings in the show is this precise architectural sketch of an observatory she discovered in John Termontar, an influential trip she took in 1984 to India. The structure itself is a form of geometry, it is a geometric form, and as we see it in Andrade's sketches, it bisects the landscape creating new vantage points and new ways of seeing. In her own practice, these were only jumping off points, and she would take them and interpret them to create these new compositions or new ways of thinking through geometry. In the end, Edna was most recognized for her paintings, and there are two in the exhibition upstairs. However, it's in her drawings that we see her mind at work. The exhibition itself takes its title from a quote from her teaching notes. In these teaching notes, she herself speaks about the importance of imagination. As a faculty, as she says, for structuring life and organizing relationships and making mental images, but as a faculty that itself is never static. It has been an honor to learn through the act of looking at Andrade's practice, and my learning has been deepened profoundly through the opportunity of conversation. And for that, and much more that has brought us here, I'm indebted to the exhibition's co-curator, Madeline Murphy Turner, who will introduce tonight's speakers.",

6,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:801477?width=3000&height=3000,"Sem título, da série Jatobá ",Rosana Paulino,2022,"Good evening everyone. It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the Harvard Art Museums for this year's annual student lecture featuring the acclaimed artist, Pasana Palino. We are thrilled to have you with us for what promises to be a powerful and deeply enriching evening. My name is Madeline Markey Turner and I serve as the Emily Raul Pulitzer Curatorial Fellow in contemporary drawings here at the Harvard Art Museums. I'm honored to represent the museums tonight and to co-present this program in collaboration with our valued partners at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. Before we begin, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the many colleagues who made tonight's program possible and a badass, gentle, tionic, venturi, and Jean Burke and Métra Bospore from the Harvard Art Museums, Audrey Rice Smith, Hanna Tostilva, and Louise Bernard and Cremendez Wood, and Marcella Romance and Soul Carbonel from the David Rockefeller Center. Their dedication and spirit has really brought this evening to life. Most importantly, I want to offer our deepest gratitude to Pasana Palino, who joins us here tonight from South Paolo, Brazil. We are incredibly fortunate to have Pasana here with us in Cambridge during what has been really a whirlwind tour of the Northeast. Just last week she gave a public talk at the High Line in New York City in conjunction with her striking mural, The Creation of the Creatures of Day or Night. And she also opened a stunning new exhibition at Métra Bospore in Traybaca. If you're headed to New York soon, I strongly encourage you to experience these groundbreaking projects firsthand. Pasana Palino's work sits at the vital intersection of social, ethnic, and gender issues, with a focus on the lives and legacies of Black women in Brazilian society. Her practice confirms the structural violences of racism and the enduring impact of slavery, weaving together personal history and collective memory in a deeply reflective and transformative way. Through her investigation of myths, memory, and psychic imprint, Palino reconstructs not just images but entire frameworks of understanding, offering us new ways to see history, identity, and the body. Her work is fundamental to the story of Brazilian contemporary art and has redefined how we think about its social and aesthetic canon. In recent years, many of you may have encountered her work in major international exhibitions, such as the style Palo Biannil, The Venice Biennale in 2022, the exhibition Afro-Atlantic Histories at the National Gallery of Art, and most recently, Project a Black Planet, the Art and Culture of Pan-Africa at the Art Institute of Chicago, which we'll travel to Macbaw in Barcelona later this year. In 2024, alone, Rosanna has been celebrated with major solo exhibitions at the Casa Museo Clavin and the Museo de la Tinoa Maricano in Buenos Aires. In late 2024, she was also awarded the inaugural artistic Freedom Prize by the Monque Museum in Oslo, honoring an artist who exemplifies courage and integrity in their practice. That recognition feels especially meaningful to us here at Harvard, as our current special exhibition is devoted to Edward Monque, the very artist who inspired the award. To have both artists, Monque and Palino present here at the museums at this moment feels not only timely but profoundly symbolic. We are experiencing a period in this country when artistic freedom is under substantial threat on many levels. Diverse perspectives are being silenced through the strategic termination of grants for scholars, artists, exhibitions, and museums. Rosanna's practice has been dedicated to speaking out against such forms of institutional erasure. For this reason and many others, it is truly an honor to have her here. We are also proud to now include Rosanna's work in our permanent collection at the Harvard Art Museums. Her invocative drawing from the Jettobah series is currently on view and drawn to Earth's contemporary art and environment in the Americas. Our collection gallery installation in gallery 1120 upstairs. Since the installations opening last month, I've had the pleasure of discussing Hosanna's work with students and visitors from Cambridge and far beyond, and witnessing its residents has really been one of the highlights of my career. As the curator Igor Simoa has observed, Hosanna Palino's work combines sheer beauty with the language of fury, criticism, faith, and politics, interrogating the living remains of colonialism and the mirage of progress in Latin America. Her practice was both a reckoning and a restoration, a challenge, and a gift. With this in mind, I would like to respectfully acknowledge that Harvard University is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusetts, the original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge. I would like us all to pay respect to the people of the Massachusetts tribe, past and present, and honor the land itself which remains sacred to the Massachusetts people. Following Hosanna's lecture, we will be joined by Lucy Williams, a second year PhD student in the Department of History of Art and Architecture, and a graduate student teacher here at the museums. Lucy's studies are animated by an interest in textiles, their design, production, and the lives of the people and animals that make them. Her research explores this in the context of Soviet Central Asia, probing how concept of tradition, modernity, montage, and patchwork are reflected in the textiles of the region. Lucy has been an incredible collaborator in shaping this program, and I'm so grateful for her thoughtful engagement and deep commitment to Hosanna's work. We will conclude with time for audience questions, so I encourage you to hold your thoughts until the end of the program. And afterwards, I invite you all to join us upstairs in Gallery 1120 to view Hosanna's work on view in Drone Tour, and to continue this conversation in the presence of her work. Please join me now in warmly welcoming our distinguished guest, Hosanna Palino. Thank you. Hello, everybody. It is an enormous honor to be here. I am very happy, of course, and I thank you for coming tonight with all these rain outside. I really thank you for coming. Thank you, Madeline, thank you, Hi, Madeline, these students for this invitation. So, I will tell you about my work, and after you can have time to questions and we will discuss this. And before I started to show the last researches that how you have here for the Jato Baseri, I would like to show my work in order that you can understand what drive me. To do the researches that I am doing now. So, I started to show some artworks. I am here that you can find these at my website that I know necessary, and I started showing some images. I am from Brazil. I was born in 1987, and the country was facing us, it's facing the problems with racial issues. I am black, I was born in a black family. So, to understand that, to understand my culture, I started to look around me. I started to think how my culture, how my family has made me, and look around. One thing that I really do in my research is looking around me. I can look at my environment, I can look for the animals, the things that has inside my home, to natural world. I really like to look around me in order to understand myself and my position in the society, like the Brazilian society. I consider this one my first start to work, the one that really opened the doors for the cultural environment. This is the one of memory in Portuguese, but it is a memory. It came from an object that had a room in my parents' door, and it has a small shape that we call this in Portuguese, Patoa. This is there to protect the house and the people that live inside the house. It is there, above the door, during ten years or more, and you don't pass in a door that has an object without being taught by this. I was curious when I was a child, what we have inside that. I used this shape to do this using all the photos of my family, and I made these like an enormous wall, but I could see all my genetic poo there. I myself, I'm not in this wall because it's not necessary, all my genetic poo is there. The idea was to think how we can put this population together, and you can ignore one of them if you find in the crowd, but you can't ignore 1,500 pairs of eyes on you. This is the size of this work. We have 1,500 pieces. There are actually 11 images, so it's like an enormous memory game. You can see that sometimes they are together, we have images together, and I started the idea of putting things together and using the stitching to put them together. The things that I knew about how to deal with this material. For example, we have this other master door, there's an embroidery hoop that I use the images of my family, like this, for example. The line is something that is very important. In this case, I use the GZ structure to show the violence that the black women are also being met in Brazil. The eyes that can see, the moves that can speak, I use this that we can find in home to show this kind of violence. But you can use the line, like in this case, for example, for stitching or I can use the line like these in drawings. Oh my career, I draw a lot. I consider myself as a person that is a narcissist, that has a main media. I will love drawing. So as I told you, I can use some forms, I can find some objectives that I can find at home. In this case, for example, I use it to observe spider nets, cocoons that I find, I found it at my home, environment. And using this in a metaphorical way to discuss what it is to be a female in our word dominated by male. So you can see like this, the thread, the line is coming from the eyes, from the move. And I can do one aspect that I think that is interesting is that I can deal with these in different ways. I can start making these drawings and going for this for example, where I made these, these are sculptures, these are cocoons. I show you like this so you can see better. And I hear you really can see the detail. As an artist, I think that is important that I can deal with an idea in a very different ways. So I can deal with these ideas of cocoons like protection, but like something that can maintain you inside. You think that you are protected, but sometimes you are not, it can be a trap. It can be a place, a cocoon, can be a place that can maintain you safe, but it can be also a trap. You can be trapped inside the home, you can be trapped inside your word. So I use it in this idea, and the idea of to put together the human being and the animal, such as part of the same structure, for me it's very important. Because one thing that really make me crazy is to think how in the Western world we think that the human being is here and the nature is here. That's not, that's the opposite. The nature is here. If a nature, if a nature do like this, we just disappear. So it is very, for me it is very important to this idea that human beings is special and over the nature. So it's not that to put together, so my work is the human body and the bodies and the things that I can find in the nature. So it was very interesting science. So this is a way also to play with some ideas about science and about how the Western would see the things the human being in the others, the animals and the plants. But at the same time my interesting science directed my research through another field that was to think how science built a country like Brazil and how science is still in that society today. So I can use science in very different ways. In this case I started to use some images as well. I started using photography images, but for my family. But in a moment I realized that was not possible just to use my family memories to discuss the Brazilian society. So I started looking for photography of blacks in the Brazilian history. And I found one photography that was made and the archive is here in Harvard that photography is from the Agassiz Expedition to Brazil. In Brazil he called him for photography that his name is Augustistal and he took some photos in Rio de Janeiro like this one that you can see the the back front inside and this pose was invented in Rio de Janeiro in 1865. And it's interesting to think how it has marketed that he started the word not only Brazilian history but these is used to teach today insomni security unit to register the people. So we have this and I started to think how images how this forces science that we had in Brazil has it marked black population there has it made like a spot on blacks in Brazil. So I made this work that's called the settlement where I use the I choose the photos the images from Agassiz and use the images to make an environment where we had we had these armies we had the images of the sea and the sound of the sea and that the images from black side in front I was thinking about the crossing the sea how it was made and how these people cross the sea and survive the major culture in a country like Brazil. So I use like this this is the the image I took the image from the book the original size was 11 centimeter very small and I love technology and I call the friend of mine so we could use technology to make the image larger in order to make it this work. You have to look at that to be here this tool 13 we don't have this technology has we have today now I can just use a cell phone to the photo and I have had this and very good quality but in tool 13 was not like exactly like this we had to work on this image and the idea is to think about it to rebuild yourself and I like it to work as well. Like thinking about the home of the where the equal can cure equal so to think about the damage caused by the images in the Brazilian black population could be a good idea to use the same images but changing the key. So this images that were in a situation of vulnerability this pair no I am changing this I put I gave it to her I heard and in this case for example I gave it to her a fetus but we can realize that we have this teaching in this case are you call this suture. If you look at the arm for example we can see that the parts of the body does not fit it is impossible to fit because this is the trauma this is the trauma of this labor how is it possible to cure this trauma. It's a question that I ask myself every day how can we cure this trauma so this image does not fit and I call this like sutures like a surgery for example I use it this very have line black line has a surgery line but at the same time this but I gave it her root. Because these people they were able to make a country even with this suffering they make a very powerful culture in a country has Brazil is until today. I like to change the same image for example to think in different ways how can I use this in a college for example how can I use these in different ways. In other ways in these ideas of science thinking about the scientists that went to the country and mapping people mapping nature mapping all these species in order to exploit the results of the country of the people. I made these like the dog there is of Evie these are mixed in media on paper and then I made the also Adam and Evie. It's a series that has maybe 20 pieces or more or less these and I carry on this idea to research false science or pseudo science in a home which has built Brazil in this book. Let's call the natural history but we can see that is this natural history has two comas like in Spanish language because is this natural will natural is science really a free kind of knowledge is this history natural I don't think so. We have a lot of politics we have we have a lot of science we have a very bad way to use science is so this natural history this to comas and this is the opening page of the book. I would like to have a book very precious something as they are used to make to say to will rope to say ideas from Disney word to will rope so I made this it opens me to these phrases in Portuguese progress does not so is a salvation of the sound is more pleasant. That means the progress of the nation's the salvation of the souls the love for the science and here the flower the fauna and the people and also discussing in this book for home nature. The whole image of the whole photography was used to mapping and to make a kind of to justify a false superma system of false year-rt between people. I like this I use this book and this idea to have some images and I cannot and this and I can. The description about science and I use this for my friends is that I started the book like this I saw myself as the observation of the souls are like these entitled the giving again the hurt by the black women are just forgot how part of the ice as well. I am going a little friend but if you are interested can go to my website and you find all these images there and I'm ever discussing how the controversy was made using the ideas of science and these read that logic for example and I just like very much because we have so many images not for no Brazil but for Cuba and then I can say what is Cuba what is Brazil because the black people were. But we are actually has the same time. So here for example there is the permanence of structures to deal with this idea of a whole thing does not change how they are distilled that all the time repeating repeating repeating. And we have these images as well that they do the gradimals where I use the images of the old ladies from the slavery period in the performers. They are more shalene. It's cheaper than on their body bringing back these females for life this is right because these images they were printed in transparent cloth so you can see the image you just can see the image when shalene put this all her body. So shalene does exist because these females exist before shalene and they come back to life because shalene does exist. So it's the thing about time in that in circular way in a different way that's very common for some people that came from Africa and I'm still in Brazil having this kind of culture and ideas about time. And the interest to it I am interested as well about the commerce and the science and the hardest people were is Africa and Brazil and also from America were exploited. So I made these in some relation the time of things where I used some special ideas for God's name, spices, spices that started the idea of colonization, how it started like a global commerce and ended. Having human beings has the main thing to be exported you know like it changes. When they did that could you put the word together in slavery and the first time you had this kind of slavery that was we have we have a heavy slavery in the history of the world. And it was if you don't have to pay money to pay you know this kind of stuff but for the first time you have slavery that was basically the color of this king and the fair not of the people. And they did change the and molding the word hard we have until today is by basis for this kind of racism that we have to today. So we have this but I was thinking this kind of research and I started to think about the black female psychology. I was thinking about a parade that we had some years ago about the goddesses the power of the feminine and the way we think about this I started a research and I went to the library and we called find the idea of God's name for the female power but in this book is never in Brazil never. Find when I started this research black goddesses it was like the black female has no right to be to have your power or to have a psychology and then I'm dealing with ideas like psychology for example I would have I prefer to use it the way. When I look at a research and about something very specific like for science I go to the photography for example but when I'm dealing with this subject that is quite difficult you can't put your hands on psychology when I'm dealing with this kind of thing I use a drawing and for me to see the trouble use it drawing to discuss this kind of stuff because my mind I don't know how to explain it's hard but it's like. To be free to be guided by your mind your hand of course I make a lot of research but when you are drawing for example it's like you lose yourself in the drawing so you can be free to use the drawing something that way I discuss it how science I can do. So I started to think about the black female personality in Brazil and I started to think about God's name because God is very powerful that is called the Ilson Anorysia in Brazil and she is so powerful that she is compared to a razzabufalo and people say that she is strong has a buffalo but she is delicate and has a butterfly. I think that's so powerful to describe all this is strange that the Ilson Anorysia has and I started to make some drawings thinking about personality about psychology and I started with this buffalo we have other here and then this made me think about the nature and the different phases of the female for example to be young to get old to be mother and I started to use the drawing and the little leaves that they plant so I started this area that's called laid off plants say all of us plant us and then we have one here and another here but there we realized that that was not good that I had to have a plant but not in plant not in leaf and I started to put more attention that plant that was close to me and the relationship that this plant was not good. I started to have a plant with Brazilian natural religion for example and that was close to me in a park where I used to walk for example and I went to walk in a park close to my home where we have a plant a tree especially a razzabah that is called a razzabah that is almost 500 years old. Can you imagine what is to be close to a live being that is almost 500 years old. I was so impressed by this razzabah that I started to make this here is of a razzabah so the bus 3. The one thing that is interesting is that when I am working for example which different plants which one has a personality so the shop of bus for me they are looking like the normal grandma they have something that is half but it is calm as well they have time and they are very slow and normally I don't have the control I just start to draw and the draw the result is something that I really can control the result just appear. If you compare for example this razzabah and I will be back like this they are younger for example they are different I mean for me I feel they are different and then so we have these and then we have this razzabah and I have to be sure what we have here. Sometimes I make the drawings and I think it is a copy when I have a different energy or when I have an exhibition like a Biennale we need to put much attention and make a lot of effort for example. When I was college to go to some part of the Biennale I made this I started to make another city of the five males that the Mangruvi series that is 2023. I like to say about the drawings that are really enjoying drawing. I don't make for example if I have to make a large drawing I don't like for example to make a small drawing and project the image all the wall that is going to just put the line that we have projected on the wall. I don't like to work like this. I like to really feel myself, feel my body close to the paper. It is like to get a kind of energy that these females can give to me. When you do a normal drawing and the result was this, when you do a normal drawing you have to feel your body. You have to stay close so you can put a kind of energy in that work that you are doing. We have this room that I occupy in São Paulo, Biennale. We had four triptfies. The one that I was working with is this, Garsta Branca, Vitevilo. This room you can have an idea. This is the guy that is putting it on the wall so you can see that they are really large artworks that I made. They are directly on the wall. I just put the paper on the wall and then it is working and it is very difficult. You can be living that very difficult because when I finish the drawing I will completely exhaust it. It is like to be enough height because I had to go to a pledge hard, go up and down and see the drawing from a distance. I just come back to the work and do that again. It is a lot of effort but I think that is necessary to get the result that I wanted to look in for. In this case it is a non-invivalent environment and I started to realize more and more that the work has a free will. It is going to a direction that I did not intend when I started this research about the black females and the black psychology. It is like that they have a free will. They directed me to do that. They started to draw more and more in the drawings. After this I come back to the series of fish at the bus. Because these mangrove languages are so large. I do not want to do this in one size. For me it is very difficult to try to put these mangroves in a small paper. I do the mangrove series at a minimum 2 meters high. No less than this. Because they need a lot of space. When I am doing this I want to come back to these idea of the plants. But I do not have all these space. I come back to all the ideas. I come back to the shuttle bus again. This one is the shuttle bus that you have here at the gallery. I like this very much because you can see these small trees coming from this shuttle bus. When I saw for the first time it is 3. Close to my home. I thought this tree is almost 500 years old but it is not so large. The trunk was not so thin as you can imagine if it is 500 years old. We realized that we had a shuttle bus here and another there. Now the same came from the same root. In this case this tree is not the trunk is not large. But we have other trees that came from the same root. It is the same tree. We can have another tree here and there. So we have the main tree and four tree more. I will slide them. This is just the same. I tried to show these coming from here working on these species. These are small trees that come from here. At the same time we have the other tree on the other hand. Small jattabah coming. The other tree is growing. We have a pomegranate in the other hand. I started to make jattabahs. But they started to become another thing. I have a pomegranate tree. This is from her hand. I love pomegranates. They are from a plant. I use a lot of this idea of pomegranates. I made this series. I made this one. It is the twigs. It is very large. It is not as small as possible. I worked on the wall. It is a deep tree. I used to see the colors. The two different parts of the diptychic. I wanted to have an idea. I asked him to record. He is a patchworm cleaning the wall before getting out of the wall. I showed this that it was a huge challenge. It was the high line project because it was a mural. I was able to make a lot of paper. I decided to make a graphite. I decided to make a graphite. I decided to make a large paper. It could be easy for me. It could be easy for me. I did the job. Now after we took a picture of this drawing, the original drawing, my assistant received some images from the high line. We made this using computer graphics to have an idea. It could be the result. It is important to think about this kind of challenge. How can we use technology in this case? I used watercolor a lot. We used it when we went to the gallery. You can see that the points of ink used a lot. I used it a lot. This depends on how much you can paint. I had to think on how to solve this challenge. And one thing is important to say about a mural. They painted by hand. When they told me, oh my god, they are questions. They painted by hand. Some things are absolutely fantastic. So we had, how will you do that? This part of color, different colors, as we have in what the color are, where we have, when I have the triptkins or gyptokids that are enormous, but I use a acrylic to keep ink that is liquidated. So the result is very similar to other colors, but not in this case. That was impossible. So what my ancestors did made, then here they are painted. We just make it like a map. You can see all that lines are like a map of different colors. And we use the scale that you're in there now, the scale for color. So we sent it today. How that map is separated by colors. So they were painted by hand, each part of this. That's all, work that's fantastic. They were painted in part by parts, in order to, when we see this from a distance, it looks light, enormous about their color. So here they are working. And you can see the colors, they're merging, for example. We have a very contrast here, that's because the photo, when we see it, really the panel, the contrast is not so high. And this is the end, the final panel that is nine meters. So it's really enormous. It's a building, it's a lateral way of a building. So it's enormous. And I'm not child, and that's fantastic. But anyway, you could realize that I'm dealing with the same substance. I'm dealing with the same idea. I am dealing with the same subject, what is to be black, what's to be a black woman in a country like Brazil. Sometimes I use some materials that I think that are more than equated to discuss some subject for example, photography, when I dealing with the racism and the house science, what was the world played by its science in the construction of racism in my country. But when I'm dealing with ideas and something more like psychology, that's not so hard as you use drawing, this is my practice. Well, that's it. Thank you very much for coming and if you find my information, here. Applause. I want to thank you again for such a fast paced, but broad sweeping account of your practice. I think it really comes across your experience as a teacher and as a researcher, which at Harvard Art Museums, I think, is an important sort of touch point. I would love to hear you talk more about the spiritual and the mythological perspectives in your work, especially in the Jatoba series. Your drawing on view upstairs is really complex in how it thinks about the relationship between people and the forests and in your presentation, you liken the Jatoba's to grandmas, it's so beautiful and poetic as a woman plant hybrid. For many world views, including Afro-Diasporic traditions, the connection between the human and the forest is deeply spiritual and at the same time, the drawings from the Jatoba series make me think of the Greek myth of Daphne and Apollo, where Daphne flees from Apollo and calls upon her father, the river god, to help. And he transforms her into a tree to protect her from Apollo's advances. Can you tell us a bit more about how you're representing and combining different mythologies and spiritual world to using your work? Mm-hmm. Okay, can you hear me? Okay, oh yeah. Well, I came from a culture, for example, that we have an enormous respect for nature. And we believe that we have so many energies as well that in the nature and that they are very important for life. So these respect for example, if you go to take leaves from a plant, for example, to make a remedy for you or to look in for cure, you have to ask a permission. You can't just arrive in the tree and you take leaves. You have to ask permission for doing that. So since I was a child, I learned that we are not above the nature. We are part of the nature. So if I am part of the nature, how could it be to be a tree, to be like a tree? Or to stay so immersed in the forestry and the nature that I myself are part of that environment, part of that ecosystem. And then this for me is something that's calling my attention. It's the day I am thinking more about it that if you human being, the human being, who himself, herself inside the nature, has another being. Now I'm delighted to be here. And how this kind of knowledge that came from nature with people, from black people, from people that lives inside the forest. Maybe they have the key, if it's possible, if it is still possible to change this climate change, this climate change that we are facing. Because the human being will just appear, the flow is real much. So many animals, so many animals is stable here. But I thought if the nature do this, we just disappear. We just disappear. So the best thing for me to think about my psychology, and this psychology of blacks, for example, in my case, in the black females, was thinking then together with nature. But at the same time, I like the symbolic in arts. I started, since I started my career, for example. When I showed to you that if females, cocoons, those if females, that was about a beetle that I found in my studio. I found the beetle. Oh my god, this is so fantastic structure that can protect it is, they can protect it. The animal, how is it? Well, how is this thing that protected can be a trap? Are the spiders, for example, that has the net? And I was thinking about some of the mothers that can make that kind of cocoon that they can make. They are children, so fragile. So we have a lot of things. When we think about symbolic, about the metaphors with the animals, the flores, the different people has the same. We thought about the death and the fall, about this idea that she became in a tree. But we have lots of different mythologies where we have the trees that are like the human beings, like the tree that can talk or the tree that when you could, when blood, have lots of histories about this. And also for me, it's logical. For me, it looks logical to put together these ideas that came from different perspectives. And to start to think more about how we are part of the nature. We are not above the nature. And the big being can still save the human life if we are affected this. Thank you. Can you hear me? Yes. Building on that question, mentioning Daphne and Apollo, as you did Lucy. And then also the way that you're thinking about women and relationship to nature from other spiritualities and other mythological places. I made to think about artistic formation and your studies, perhaps, as a young art student, because in a context like the Northeast of the United States in a Western context, I would say, like, Daphne and Apollo Greek mythology is so central to what we're seeing as we're studying art. So I'd like to hear more about what you were seeing as you were studying art, what you were thinking about. And I've been other contexts, heard you talk about, really the lack of representation of black artists as you were really coming into your own as a young artist. And of course, in the context of Brazil, if we think about the dominance of concrete geometric abstraction. Kind of how could we forget about that? It's just kind of given us a sense of what that was like for you as you were really seeing art for the first time and forming your own vision. Mm-hmm. Well, that was very hard. That was not easy because we must realize that I started like studying almost 40 years ago. I am an artist now for more or less 30, more than 30 years like artists. And at age, we do not have the internet. We do not have this kind of discussion that I could see. Artists from black did I ask for that, for example. And so, at that time, until today, the Brazilian universities, when you are talking about art, they are very Western. Sometimes I think that they think they are more Westerners. They, you know, they Western, you know? That was very difficult because I could not see myself inside of the university. I could not see the group that I came from inside the university. And then that was very violent. I remember that when I started as a student, for example, in my first year, my first week as a student, I just told you to the group, you forget everything about the things that have done until now because you will be artists that you are university. You will be, how can I say, editors? Educated, educated. Sorry? Educated? It's okay, it's a matter. Every day. Sorry? Every day. Every day. Like intellectual. Like intellectual. Yeah, intellectual artists. So it was the first week of classes. You be educated. You be artists from the university. And I just remember I taught myself, okay, what can I do? This, I just take off my ski and put this outside the room, the crash room. So that was really difficult to deal with this in Brazil. And then we had this idea about the show, the documentary about Brazil has a vocation for geometry. That's not, absolutely. Absolutely. That was a very small group, and which is the part of the culture that was in some polygene de Janeiro. How so is my group, came to represent a country so large as Brazil is. That is madness. And another thing that I did not told you, that's about carnival, about this college disambla. So all that visuality from scholars disambla, for me, that is very important. I remember when I was a child, for example, I went to my grandma's house because they have a place, I hope, quite close to her, that they used to make the clothes for the carnival parade. So they, now the things for the carnival parade. So when they started to take this from the house, from inside the house, to put it in the cars, to go to the parade, all the children, waited to see that, oh my god, that for me was something really fantastic. So I realized that if I really could be an artist and make something really useful, I had to use this material. So I think that that was not easy for me, but I think that was not easy for the teachers as well, because that was all the time. But they encourage me, so many teachers encourage me to look for these, and I'll say, okay, you really have to go and look for who you are. And now I was the only black woman in the university, in the main classes, by art classes. I studied at university of São Paulo. Universidad did some powders, he's considered the best one in the country. And sometimes, of course, the artists are considered the best in Latin America. So it's very lit university. So that was not easy, but I think that has not tried. What could I do? And so I started really to think, so the memory wow, for example, and then I consider my first start to work, how was the student? It was a way even to survive, maybe, looking for my house, to stay at my home, but not like a trap. I think I'm not like a trap, but like a place that could really give you a strange, to look at this and to start to really make things that had value for me, not far to the university. Thank you. No problem. Speaking of the universe, and we don't have to stay on the Jettoba, but you use specific trees, plants, and animals. Jettoba is the mangroves. Yes, me. And in your talk, and also in our conversation now, you brought up climate change. And how the climate change is sort of the symptom of mankind, humans putting themselves above nature and not seeing the interrelationship, sort of the hybridity, if you will, between humans and nature and how we're formed by nature and sort of informing nature at the same time, given the climate change and the related sort of ecological consequences I'm thinking in Brazil deforestation, specifically, you mentioned a particular sort of intervention or cure or path forward being humans going back into nature, back into the forest. What are some ways that in your opinion, if nature is all around us and we're a part of nature, what are some other ways besides the forest that we can see these relationships in our lives? Oh, I think that we can listen the ones that live there. This is the first thing. I am not romantic, of course, I love technology. I use technology all the time, my artwork. But when we see, for example, the youngers that live close to the heevers in Brazil, the people that we call the heebe e-rings, that are kind of cultured, form of the English part for black or native people that live in the life of the directed link to the heever, are they younger native people? They use technology a lot, but they don't destroy. They understand that we can put things together. So if in the best way to come back to the forest is listening the ones that live there, and that know how to do this, they can, they preserve, they live inside, they can use the technology preserve the nature, and they still die. They are living well with that environment. So we have just to come back to listen this. And I think the in Brazil, for example, it's very difficult for people to accept this, that we have to listen the ones that has this kind of experience because they are close to that, like primitive ignorance, but they use technology very well. They learn very quickly how to deal with this. So I think that they have the key to survive. They have the key because we feel it's wrong in this idea that the nature is something that can be exploited. The hows we are doing now, we don't have much time. Maybe we should see if there's questions from the audience. If somebody has a question. I think we could keep asking you a ton of questions, but why don't we let... Let me have there. How would you like... Yeah, let's wait for the microphone quickly because just for the recording, if you don't mind. Okay, can you hear me? You can. Thank you so much for your talk and thank you for coordinating all of this. I'm excited to see the show with your work on view. I had a question. It was really interesting seeing you and hearing you talk about these works in connection with your earlier practice because hearing you talk about the tree and this idea of the tree being there for 500 years and how that's so inspiring is what's making me think about how nature is an archive and thinking about it after having just seen the photographs as an archive and how this idea of nature... We don't think about nature as being this archive with a capital A and then thinking about your interventions into that archive through your embodied sewing and this very physical action. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the relationship between those earlier pieces and what you're doing now with these drawings. Mm-hmm, okay. Let me count C for example. I told you about that work that we have the female yo and the fruity, the back, the inside. The last one, it has the roots. So the idea of roots, we can't even see... We see the nature, we see in this case, we see the... In the college, for example, the image of the plants, we can see the roots, we can see the ideas of born is... I mean, even when I use the archive, you can realize that archive in good time, we have together with the archive of the nature. Because for me, as I see nature and the human beings, the same part in thinking about the Brazil, especially, we think about how I think, about how the blacks, the nature, the nature of people, how they were there to be exploited. So, in a way, they are at the same level. This problem about not to be inside the nature or not to be at this level is not a problem for these people. This is a problem for the white people that exploited the country. So, for me, to think... Even to think they archive, I think about a special kind of archive. I'm not using any archive. Are you using... These are... Let's see, thank you. I am using... Oh, sorry. These are the archives that has the human body, but it has this plant that is coming from her back, like a column, how they interpret our column. So, here we can find still this idea about the nature. And we have your example, and here, and here. So, all the time, these people, the blacks, and these are putting in the nature at the same level, thinking that we are... We consider the nature as the same level for us. And this is a kind of rebellion or a kind of two-faced system as well. This is not... I use it like this, it's not just because it's beautiful, but it's just to say, okay, look at this, this is possible. So, when I... This, for example, when I put like this, the flower, the fauna, and the jane, and the people, so are they all at the same level? I can't think the human being without think about the nature, look like this. But when I think about psychology, for example, I don't like to use... It's very difficult to use the images of... Thinking about psychology, about the intimacy, about the things that are inside me, are inside the black females using photography, or using like high images, for example. I feel free, I think that it's easier to do these using now. So, I think that if you have a relationship with that, we are discussing the same thing. We are discussing in a case how the body, how the color of this king was used to dominate the group. But what about this psychology of this group? In order to do this, for me, it's easier working using drawing. So, the images of plants that I had, for example, for example, from archives, I do it myself. I'll draw me. And doing this, it's easier to put my inner visions on the paper. We have a lot of unconscious as well. So, in order to liberate these unconscious, I have to make myself free. For me, it's possible to achieve this only using drawing. Bonne Lola, we have a question here. Hello, thank you for the talk. Really great so far. You're just talking about how you use photography when you are looking at documentation, archival images or things like that. And then you mention psychology, you use drawing. I'm curious about the sculptural work that you showed. Is there a specific way that you approach that as well or is it sort of a combination of both? Yeah, like in the installation with the ceramic pieces. Are there any specials? Yeah, and with the ceramic pieces as well, like the terracotta. Yeah, I'm just curious how you think about, or how you approach the sculptural work. In this case, it's not really about the sculpture, but it's put things together. It's easier than I was thinking about. The history of the colonization of the South American in Brazil and Africa. But when I put, when I think really about this sculpture, like in the beginning, for example, a thing that the beginning that we have this sculpture, you know what I'm talking about? And more, more, more, more. Like this, for example. I must think about the ebroges that after became the women tree. So this idea of ebroges is still present. And one thing that I do love is clay. Clay is absolutely fantastic because I have to put my hands there, knowing the few. I think that's some materials. They are better than others, to discuss some questions. The clay, for example, something warm, I can put something like, has life in clay. That's not like a marble, for example. And so this is a material that I can use to discuss about mythology, something that symbolic in my opinion, for me, it works for me. A thing that clay works like the drawing is the same thing. I can liberate myself when I do this. I feel myself free. I can use my hands. At the same time, I like it from materials, for example, like thread, the material that people don't put much attention, that is considered for me or material. And this is very old, it's two or three. It's more than 20 years ago, and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do it, and so thread was not being used a lot in contemporary arts, and I had to undervaluated material. And I like to use these materials, and maybe to kind of valorize, make them valuable. And so use thread as well, something that was very good for this kind of discussion. So I never think, which material will be better to discuss the question? The result that I can have with drawing, absolutely will not be good, maybe for using, for discuss, which is without science. So I never think about this. I have an idea, and an after is how I will work with this idea. Use is not to work on, for example, using these archived, or I have it to use others, and I am, other time looking for the best material to translate an idea. And so it can be in the sculpture, or installations I love, installation because I can use a lot of different materials, for example, that I feel myself completely free. And it works only for, discuss some subject, it's not your others. I think I responded to you, it's okay. Any other questions from the audience? There. Ana Maria. Thank you so much. This is a wonderful talk, and thank you for making the work that you make, and inspiring us. I want to follow on this thread, and no one intended, with the materiality of your work. I found, I love the paradox that you use in terms of these images representing both protection and entrapment. And I was seeing that there is this very powerful, literally, paradox in the use of some of the materials that you use, where, for instance, the thread has being able to express both power and vulnerability in the same time. And I'm just wondering if you could reflect more, or press more on this use of the materials to express an idea, because I think that you are actually teasing out these paradoxical states, like power and vulnerability or entrapment and protection. And it seems like something that is sort of a connective thread throughout your work. And I was wondering if it's something that you reflect on in terms of the materials. Okay, about materials. Yeah, that's very important. The material is really, wow, can I say, I feel the material. One thing that we can consider when we are making art is that it hurts not a science, it's not so rigid. I studied a lot, we studied a lot, we read the book, is we make it researches, but sometimes when you are starting to really work, really to produce a network, you have to turn off the part of your mind, maybe that is linked with the research, that research that you can find in books. And so you choose the materials. I put a lot of materials sometimes on the table. And sometimes this one. Don't ask me why. But sometimes it must be like this. No, this one. This one, because this is important to liberate your unconscious, your mind. Some of the works I really have to know how to deal with this. An example is the mural, because that's had some specificities that I had to think about. How can I reproduce this? It will be in the weather, you're suffering with the weather, or others, for example, if they are very large, and they have a weight, they have to think about the weight, about the durability of the material, if the color will be okay, so one part is very rational. Even sometimes I have to count people, I have to count people to work with me. To make a sentimental settlement, for example, we did not have technology good to start with images like this, and make that enormous, for example. So I had to cut, no, no, no, no, this one thing, because I remember one thing. To make this, I had to cut a person from technology to work with me, and then the weather was, for example, come back to the police. We have a lot of technology on this artwork. This was really difficult, because I wanted to cut, I wanted ceramics, but I wanted exactly this color. So I love it, the cut, and then one of these is, because I used to observe some insectes at the art of my parents, for example, and they make it like that towers of the hakata. So I like these, and I want to use this color. But the hakata is one of the ceramics that the weight is the most weighted, that is very weighted. So it was not too possible to put all that pieces that we've got, pieces of the hakata in a while, because it will be very heavy, very heavy. So we had to go in a center, specializing ceramics in Brazil, that is very specializing, is one of the most specializing centers in ceramics, the idea of it, that superconductors, that superconductors, for information, to look for a ceramic that was not so heavy, that it could be, or it could be put on a wall. And they told me about this kind of a porcelain, that is very thin, but that was the most impossible to get this color in porcelain, because any kind of ink that we put, change the color in a way that was impossible to get this. So we had to go in a place, I worked with an engineer, and two specialists in ceramic mass, and I'm part, so I'm specializing to make the molds of ceramics to get this result. Let me look at this, for example. Look, so, okay, that's a ceramic, that you have to be a hakata, that's not a hakata. And then it was, we spent months looking for the solution. So, first of all, I think about what I want to discuss, and what I think, what I remember, for example, I wanted this color, I wanted this because I remember the animals, the insects inside the towers of the earth, and then this for me was wonderful, and after we started to have the challenge, that's not possible to choose, I have hakata, so the work, we start like this. And when we finish, you know, it's like this because you have to reserve a lot of different things. Even go to a center, specialize the high, specialized ceramics to get just the color. So the idea, every start, sometimes I know about it, I like this, I want this because the color, I want this because it gave it to me, and I want to discuss the sense of family, for example, so I can use clothes, or even something very violent, for example, and in the order, like this, like, no, no, no, and I can be, for example, I wanted to discuss the trauma. How can you represent the trauma? So I know that I wanted to deal with it. Be it cloth, with your sticks. So I was thinking about, okay, a trauma is like a surgery sometimes. It can, you can't leave it with the marks of a surgery, it can even save your life. But you still have that marks. So to discuss the trauma, I realized, okay, I will make like a suture, that's something that is very violent. And you can see that the body, the arm, it does not fit. That was the way to use the material to show that it was looking for, that it was how to show a trauma, how to put a trauma in a network. Of course, I spent days and days and days and days thinking, how to get this answer, how to show the trauma. The trauma is something that sometimes is so small, that we can't realize, like this, that not fit. So it's more area. But you know, the result is enormous. Thank you so much. I think something that's come out of this talk and our conversations earlier today, when you arrived, really is just how important the materiality is, how important the inter-connected is to your ideas. And I'm so happy to have these conversations, because when my colleague, Meetra, and I first saw your drawing, Chateau Ba, we were just immediately, I mean, there's so many ideas, but we were immediately drawn to the technical way that you were manipulating the watercolor and the graphite, as we were talking about. So just really these, the deep way that you're thinking about technique and materials, is just one of the many things that have come out during this day. So thank you. Thank you so much for being here with us. Thank you all for joining us this evening. The galleries are open until 830, so I hope you'll, gallery 1120, I should say. So I hope you all go upstairs and see Chateau Ba drawing on view. And I hope we can continue the conversation in other forums soon. Thank you. Thank you, Lucy. Thank you, Roy. Thank you.",

This exhibition is going to offer the opportunity to look very closely at his artistic experimentation. This is made possible because the Harveter Museums now owns one of the largest and most significant collections of the work of Edvard Mung in the United States, thanks to transformative gifts from Philip and Lynn Strauss, who began collecting Edvard Mung's work in the 1960s. Edvard Mung, technically speaking, featured collaborative research here at the Harveter Museums. Our colleagues in the Strauss Center for Conservation Studies were able to perform novel and cutting-edge research into the material and technical conditions of these paintings and prints, including experimenting with and studying pigments, binders, and different kinds of paper. By using the latest technology available, we took a really deep look at Mung's creative process. Mung is known as one of the most innovative and influential artists of the 20th century. He's most celebrated for his exploration of woodcut, but he had a voracious interest in printmaking, and he explored many other techniques in great depth. These reigns show etching to Metsutin, to Aquitin, and of course, lithography. It's very exciting to showcase our own holdings of the work of Edvard Mung alongside some very generous loans from the Mung Museum in Oslo. We're featuring Mung's matrices, wood blocks, lithographic stone, etching clay that will really allow visitors to see how his prints were made. He made some iconic works of art, but they would play with those same formal elements every which way inside out, front, back, up, down, left, right. As you start to look at these works in iteration, the formal elements themselves start to lose some of their stability. One of the best examples is known as two human beings, the lonely ones, a painting that originated in 1892, influenced etchings and woodcuts, and when that painting was lost, Mung painted it again, referring to the prints. We see this constant sort of back and forth in Mung's practice. We hope that visitors will start to question as we have what was Mung's real aim.",

Ajami is one of the largest markets in Abijong where there are many shops and street vendors and where you can find everything. Most of the people who wear Yubu Yubu second-hand t-shirts are street vendors or people who came to Ajami to do their shopping. Most of them are Yubu. I want the street looking for people who are willing to post for me and who would be willing to answer a few questions that I record with my smartphone. The language barrier is often present so sometimes I need help from passes by to translate my question and their answers. In the market the Bamba language is often used as well as Nishi which is the local slang. I always ask if people understand the message that is written on their t-shirt. For the majority the answer is negative. It is also quite complex to know how they feel when I translate the message of the t-shirt to them because of the cultural and linguistic gap. Back at the studio I made a selection of photos that I will use for my final digital collages. First I checked an image quality. I have classified the faces I'll use for digital collages by Skin Ton to make sure that the collages are cohesive. And so I can now perform image editing to much different parts of faces. The photos are prepared in the right format to be sent to the lab for printing on canvas. Each person photographed is photographed almost at life size. Each print measures 19 by 120 centimeters. After this step I will be able to start cutting out the images. I will also make the manual collages and proceed to the embroidery. Now that I have received the photos printed on the canvas I can work on them from my studio. I start by drawing the lines with a pencil to divide the image into several pieces then I cut it. I separate the character from the background. I fix them with needles to sew the wedding and the fragment of image together. The pieces will be sewn on large sections of white tool which serve as a layer and support for each image fragment. It also increases the feeling of volume and presence of the photographed character. The different layers will be brought back together later to reconstruct the image. My aim is to give the feeling of a person who would be photographed with a telephoto lens. The image of the character being sharp and vibrant versus the background being blurred. I decided to not assemble all the pieces of the background because I like the idea of an asymmetrical size and baggable shape of each image. Some elements of the background are highlighted while other elements seem less relevant to me. The embroidery threads hang over the character which hang down to the ground to accentuate the feeling of human presence like an extension of the body. The image is embroidered in several places and the character's t-shirt is still intact to keep that feeling of reality. The result is a layering of photography, jewel and entoule-woven and embroidery and quilting. Here you can see the back of the piece with several pieces of pictures assembled and the embroidery. I am now working on the large mirror. This mirror is a composition and digital collage of several photos of Contamano Market in Acra, Ghana. Once cut digitally, then printed on fabric, I embroider each image manually. Then I will piece together the image again by end stitching each embroidered piece onto the base image. The images are vibrant snippets of the commercial activity taking place in one of West Africa's largest markets. The balls of fabric contain second hand clothes which arrive in containers from Western countries. The image recreates the atmosphere of the place. The result will be a large formator by pre-meter image which presents itself as a patchwork of impressions and moments of life in Contamano Market.",
9,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:788612?width=3000&height=3000,Cove at Sunset,Edward Mitchell Bannister ,1880-1900,"Good evening. Thank you all so much for coming. To those seated in this auditorium and sharing together in this moment, and to those who will view this moment on our online channels in a future moment, to you all, I say welcome. Welcome to the Biennual Ellen Wales Randolph Coolidge lecture in American Art. We are thrilled that you are here. My name is Harris Ballard. My pronouns are he, his. And I am the Theodore East Evans Jr. Curator of American Art here at the Harvard Art Museums. In this moment of heartfelt welcome, I acknowledge that we are all guests here in this place. The Harvard Art Museums and Harvard University are situated and operate on the ancestral lands of the Massachusetts peoples, the original inhabitants of Boston and Cambridge. My colleagues and I pay respect to the Massachusetts, past, present, and future. I also believe that land acknowledgement should come with commitments. I commit to always self-learning and self-directionally participating and consulting with the Massachusetts with pride, humility, and understanding. I also commit to learning as much as I can about the incredible peoples of Tacomasa, known as the Tidewater of Virginia, fed by the Powhatan or the James River, which is my home, people by the Monican, the Rapa Hannock, and the Powhatan nations. It is these three nations that took in enslaved members who fleed their plantations and from which I stand before you today, a proud ancestor of those peoples and the peoples who cared for them. I also acknowledge that in this moment, the world is difficult. And some of us have loved ones who are yet again in the path of a major storm. I understand that in these moments being clean to our phones is important. Believe me, I do know. But I would ask you to please silence your phones or turn them off now to be with us in this moment for a little space. Should you need to leave for whatever reason? Please walk up the stairs, either the central aisle or the two aisles on either side. Restrooms once you exit these doors are to the far left of the floor. Please be your own animal in your own body in this space. We have gathered together here in real time and in the future present of virtual time for the third annual Ellen Wales Randolph Coolidge lecture. So here's how the evening will proceed. I'll say a few more words. Following that, I will invite our esteemed speaker to the podium and following her lecture, there will be a time for questions from the audience. Please raise your hands and our wonderful program assistance will come to you with a microphone. I know that sometimes in these moments, the foment and the ideas are so appendious that they roll off our minds and our tongues like water. But we want to be able to hear you and the folks listening on a recording and future time would also love to hear you. So I'm going to ask you to please hold your questions until one of our wonderful program assistance can come to you. As we near the seven o'clock hour, I will rise from my seat, lead us all another round of applause, and then we will move to our lives. So with that housekeeping done, it's time to speak a brilliant woman. Established by Dr. Catherine Coolidge-Lostavika in 2019, the Ellen Wales Randolph Coolidge Fund for American Art honors a 19th century woman of extraordinary character and insight and pays tribute to her capacious intellect, decades-long relationship to the Boston region and to Harvard, and her transatlantic connections with people, places, and works of art across Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Ellen Wales Randolph Coolidge was born in Virginia and was educated in languages, music, drawing, and history by her mother, Martha Jefferson Randolph, and her father and grandfather, Thomas Jefferson. One of only three American-born guests to witness the coronation of Queen Victoria, one of the few women born in the Americas to see the Chinese Hongs and porcelain exchanges, it is only fitting that the first endowed fund to honor a woman at the Harvard Art Museums should be named a Miss Coolidge's honor. The terms of the endowment are, quote, to ensure a dynamic and rigorous program of research, exhibitions, academic and public lectures, and publications related to our collections of 17th, 18th, and 19th-century American art. Members of the Coolidge family are with us this evening, and I would ask you to join me in a round of applause for their continued support of American art at Harvard and culture at the highest levels of diplomacy and discourse. Thank you. APPLAUSE And now to introduce our speaker. Anna Aribenden Kesson, she, her, is Associate Professor of African American and Black Diasporic Art with the joint appointment in the Department of Art and Archaeology at Princeton University. Aribenden Kesson is an immigrant writer, scholar, and curator. Her work engages with the intersections of race, labor, migration, and medicine in the visual and material cultures of communities across the Black diaspora and the former British Empire. She serves as director of art HX, art history, a digital humanities project, an object database that addresses the intersections of art, race, and medicine in the British Empire. Her first book, Black Bodies White Gold, Art Cotton and Commerce in the Atlantic world looks to the commodity of cotton, central to the slave trade and colonialism, as a focus for new interpretations of the ways in which art, commerce, and colonialism were intertwined in the 19th century. She is also working on a book project with Harvard alumna, Dr. Mia Bagnarris, now of Tulane University, currently entitled Beyond Recovery, Refleming the Dialogues of 19th century Black Diasporic Art. Her second monograph is called An Empire State of Mind, Implantation Imaginaries, Colonial Medicine, and Ways of Seeing. In 2022, 23, Arab and Inkesan's research on 19th century Black artists and intellectuals in Rome, including Frederick Douglass and at Monia Lewis, was supported by the Tara Foundation for American Art with a fellowship at the American Academy of Rome. Here at the Harvard Art Museums, the object compels us to inquiry. So you can imagine the foment of ideas in my delight upon rereading the falling passage in my beloved friend's remarkable introduction to Black bodies white gold. And its continued existence in the present, an object can never reflect its context fully, thus any historical narrative that emerges is only partial. I think of this relationship between past and present as something like an illumination by which, through careful and attentive exploration, the power of objects to open up onto the worlds they are part of might be understood. In creating the scope and trajectory of this project, I recognize my own role in the construction, reconstruction of the past. It is for this reason that I also considered the relationship between contemporary art practice and histories of colonialism to suggest that this kind of reconstruction might be a form of translation or dynamic encounter only emerging from the intensive engagement with objects themselves. It is my pleasure and my privilege to welcome Anna, Araband and Kessin to the podium. Dear Anna. Thank you for that beautiful introduction, Horace. I'm really honored to be here to share some new work with you, to reflect and think through some ideas. I'm so grateful to Horace, to Sarah, both Sarah's, to make sure to the art museum, if we're bringing me here, really grateful to the college family for creating this amazing opportunity for conversation. And as Horace said, for reflection on the ways in which art objects can open up and open us up to new worlds, I also want to say that this lecture comes from a new project that I'm working on with Mia. And so really this lecture is an honor of her. I don't think I would be looking, seeing, thinking, writing or being the kind of scholar I am without the collaboration that Mia and I have developed over the years. So I'm going to give her some shout outs during the lecture because some of these words are also coming from her. This book project is really a collaborative project, meaning we write together and rewrite together. So I'm really, as I said, grateful to be sharing this with you all. In this modestly-sized painting, Palmer River, Edward Mitchell-Bannister invites viewers to share his impressions of a grassy hill, dotted with wildflowers and sloping towards the river's edge, crested with large sheltering oaks. The pleasant viewpoint leads us down to a rocky outcrop that steadies the sandy shoreline along the river's edge, close to both land and water. The river itself, flowing not far from Providence for an island, curves towards a band of marshmallow clouds, anchored above darkened hills and clumps of trees. As with many of Bannister's paintings, Palmer River demonstrates through depth brushwork his affinity for capturing shifting light and gradations of color. He hints at weather conditions, creating a sense of anticipation. An unfolding of time is evoked by closely observed patterns of reflection between water and sky, suggesting his much longer familiarity with this place. Although a little larger, there is, compositionally, I think also a similarity between Palmer River and Harvard Art Museum's covert sunset. Here too, we see a sloping hillside supporting small groupings of trees and bushes, a curving shoreline expanding into a reflective surface, and the shifting textures of a changing sky. In both works, the curvature of the shoreline or riverbank gathers and unfolds viewers into a littoral space between land and water, between day and night, between sunshine and oncoming rain. Bannister also, as you might notice, had quite a repertoire of brush strokes, two-tone smudges, gentle caligraphic layers, circular whiffs and puffs, quickening flicks, spots and dabs that become foliage, extended streaks, nestling blocks, purposeful smears. In covert sunset, we see these gestures, along with the landscape itself, as if in a process of becoming. Notice that dark green stroke that slopes upwards in the mid-ground. Although, while firmly applied, at the point at which it anchors its surrounding shapes, its stretches and pools, lightning upwards towards the sky. As it connects and carries rocks and forest trees, these blurabandoned and changing light that flickers translucent, elusive, yet also steadfastly material. In the center, paint has been applied and then seemingly scraped. From these crimped edges, small wists fan out towards a profusion of quick scuffled brush strokes, where tones become white, pink and lavender. These are reflected, then deepened, into a fleshy pink that spreads like skin across the powder blue water, before it darkens and meets a darkening shore. In seeing a sunset, we also imagine the approaching night, composing the scene from these stretched lines and swirls from a drifting color palette, bad as to give substance to what is fleeting, both the changing light and his memory of it. There's something tangibly animating, at least for me, when you watch an impression materialized into image, of seeing vision take shape, which is what, at least in my mind, it seems, were offered in code sunset. And this is the feeling I also felt when I first came across Banister's scrapbooks, or scrapbook, now held at the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art in Washington, DC. The scrapbook contains about 100 of the artist's own sketches, rendered in varying sizes and mediums, some photographs of uncertain origin, newspaper clippings mostly published after his death, but some during his life. And an exhibition pamphlet from the Memorial Exhibition mounted by his friends at the Providence Art Club, just a few months after his death, at the Elmwood Avenue Free Baptist Church. In 1901. From the scrapbook's drawings, newspaper articles, and remembrances, we get a deeper sense of Banister's process, sketching in pencils and charcoal, sometimes water color, in plain air, and then distilling these impressions into paint back in a studio. I wonder, for example, if a sketch like this with its curved lines and flattened central plane, with its scuffed protrusions, might be one of Banister's first impressions of the darkening light at a quiet cove. His scrolling pencil lines certainly reveal his absorption in nature, his proximity to rural spaces, and his deep care for them. These affinities to place are also reinforced in different ways in the texts. For example, in a small sliver of an article, containing an interview with the black journalist, T. Thomas Fortune, Banister says, I have no desire to leave my dear New England. Banister's world, the world he shares with us, is New England. It's trees, it's grazing cows, quiet fields, crystal cliffs, sandy beaches. His small scale canvases reveal his familiarity with the area, along with the comfort and pleasure he felt while in nature. T. Thomas Fortune suggests that this commitment, this anchoring to plate to the places that he found around him, was a long-held commitment. He describes a memory that Banister recounted to him. As a young man in New Brunswick, Canada, Banister remembers lying, sorry. As a young man in New Brunswick, Canada, Banister remembers lying, and I'm quoting here, for hours stretched flat on the grassy plain, or sat perched gnome-like on some great bare rock, watching the colours die away. Banister's invitation to viewers to join him in this practice of close attention and reflection comes as if from a local informant, from someone who knows themselves to be at home in these landscapes. This anchoring as it is articulated in a painting like Palmer River, for not only are we invited to take up a perch where Banister would have stood as he sketched and painted, this position is reinforced by the letters of his autograph. As Mia pointed out to me, his signature seems at once to stand out and blend in. Notice that the pronounced diagonal slant of the capital letters E-M-B, follow the sloping contours of the grassy riverbank. Their dark colours stand out against the verdant background. The lowercase letters on the other hand, made in smaller sketchier strokes, echo the brushwork that Banister employs for the surrounding vegetation. They had it to discern, they fade into the landscape. I think Mia's observation here is brilliant, because it really gives us a sense of the stakes that landscape painting had for Edward Mitchell Banister. He blends in, he stands out, while also making a claim to artistic authority based not on territorial authority or possession, but something more intimate, even reflective. Banister's rural visions then reflect a relationship with his local landscapes that often seems at odds with conventional wisdom. His paintings and drawings demonstrate a familiarity and a delight in the natural world that we do not often associate with 19th century black experiences. Kimberley Ruffin, for example, has put it this way, quote, for as long as Africans have been Americans, they've had no entitlement to speak for or about nature. End quote. And for obvious reasons, this makes perfect sense. Bell Hook's essay, Seminal essay, and I suspect it was Seminal or is Seminal for many of us, touching the earth, traces blackest arrangement from nature, highlighting how representations of landscape have been used to both instrumentalize black lives as tools and objects of labor, while also cultivating their alienation. Forms of enshrangement that they say are also forms of psychological trauma. When addressing the depictions of landscape in black creative expression, the ontology of blackness and the ontology of nature are often positioned if not as directly opposed than as divergent. Alienation from nature rather than connection to it emerges as the default lens of analysis. And the politics of race rather than, for instance, the pursuit of pleasure or the experience of beauty tends to dominate the discourse. Yet despite the realities of marginalization, violence, and alienation that black Americans face to still face in varying scale during the post-reconstruction era, and across the 19th century, banist is understanding of his role as an artist and his relationship with nature is one of connection rather than the assrangement we've often come to assume. Now, I admit that this is very strange for me to say, because for some of you who have known me for longer, the politics of race has always been my lens of analysis. And of course, I'm certainly not saying that landscape art, regardless of the race of the painter, should not be the subject to such lines of inquiry. We need far more inquiry, for example, into landscape painting and whiteness, for example. But what I am confessing is that it has taken me some time to, and only really after starting to reread Edward Vanist's words and look again at his pictures to consider approaching landscape painting by a black artist in the 19th century through a different lens. For his contemporaries and friends, Bannister offered a shared visual experience that stemmed from this affinity with nature, but not only his representation of it. In the opening pages of Bannister's moral exhibition pamphlet, George Whitaker, who I'll be quoting from a lot tonight, a close friend of Edward Vanist's and another artist from Rhode Island, describes Bannister as an artist who, quote, painted to leave upon the canvas his impression of natural scenery, and to express his delight in the wondrous beauty of land and sea and sky. So what might we see then, if we take seriously, Edward Vanist's attempts to do just that? What might we share in when we look with Bannister at the world for which he so deeply cared? I'm not sure I've fully worked out the answers to this, but what I want to do tonight is to give you a sense of how Bannister and others in his circle might have understood his connection and his delight in nature. Using material from the scrapbook along with his paintings and drawings, I want to attempt to sketch out what it might mean and what it might have meant for his contemporaries to see Bannister's landscapes from this position of connection. And perhaps also what it might mean for us now to look for, or to imagine the possibility of a context where these kinds of relationships could underpin a 19th century black artist's work. So as we saw in Palmer River and COVID sunset, Bannister's remarkable ability to capture the shifting moods of an environment could demonstrate the interdependence of elements, light and dark, land and water, sun and rain. And so many of his paintings he builds his environments through these contrasts of scale, movement and shading. While figures might be held in attention to their surroundings, their passage across the landscape can also signal why the changes in environment. The world he builds are never static. They hum with the rhythms of both the natural and the human. They're seasonal, they're changing, they're interdependent. In many ways these adjectives might also describe the life that Bannister created. Born in New Brunswick in 1825 in Canada, his journey south, which of course is the opposite direction that many self-liberated and formerly enslaved people took, his journey south to the US in the 1840s was preceded by travels and working in the merchant navy. His interest in New England and specifically wrote Ireland landscape emerges after this relocation to Boston, a short stint as a hairdresser in the salon of his soon-to-be-wife, Cristiana Carto-Bannister, known as the Hair Doctorus, and sometime as a degaritipist. I believe there is some here in Boston that I haven't seen. His transition from hairdressing to art-making is noted and that happens only after he gets married by the writer William Wells Brown in 1860. Bannister Brown says, has long since thrown aside the scissors and the comb and transfers the face to the canvas instead of taking the hair from the head. Now in Boston, as many of you probably know, but Bannister took classes at the Lowell Institute and his continued interest in figuration and portraiture, which I'm not talking about here, I certainly shown in small numbers of sketches from his scrapbook. While he later told a friend, all that I could say in art, I cannot for one to the lack of training. His works were shown very quickly at the Boston Art Club after his relocation and eagerly sought by collectors. One of the portraits we do have of Bannister shows his dear wife, Kristiana. Perhaps a pendant piece. Here she sits in careful repose, resting her elbow on a round side table and her back against a cushioned Louis XVI style chair. A glazed ceramic vase stands on the table, the only decorative object that rhymes with the bright red ribbon, tied at her lace collar and the bow at her back. Her hair is exquisitely set. The careful curls framing her face reflected in the small droplets that hang from her ears, mirroring contemporaneous descriptions of her attention to style. Raised in a politically engaged family with Naren Gassett ancestry, Kristiana was described by T. Thomas Fortune as a woman of note. Bannister indicates his attempt, this attempt to, sorry, Bannister indicates this in his attention to small details. In a similar way as he might in his landscape paintings. And so he creates a character study of a woman composed, direct, and self-possessed. I should also say, Thomas Fortune also describes her as someone who was very direct with her ideas. So I'm always fascinated to think about their conversations. I'm particularly drawn here to Kristiana's hands and the way they form this closed circle, the way they suggest both an interconnection between artists and sitter and create a closed circuit between them. The interdependence between Kristiana and Edward ran deep. It was her financial acumen and capital built from running successful hairdressing cellons and producing herbal remedies that provided Bannister with the financial freedom to make art, take lessons, cultivate patrons. It's only after they marry in 1857 that he lists his profession officially as an artist. Kristiana's commitment to Bannister's artistic progress also matches her commitment to other forms of mutual aid. She was a vocal and active financial supporter of abolitionist and other kinds of black causes, including working with orphan children and the elderly. Perhaps it was Kristiana herself that compiled this scrapbook for while the sketches and text demonstrate Edward's artistic vision, the articles also communicate and document for posterity, both their collective and community work. We get a sense of this mutually sustaining, interdependent social and aesthetic life that the Bannister's built together and in which they lived. In Boston, the couple were deeply involved in abolitionist causes and religious communities. Bannister was also a mentor to younger artists. He was a delegate to one of the colored conventions. And we see his name on a number of petitions brought against the expansion of the fugitive slave law into the North. One story that's mentioned quite often in the scrapbook is about the part that Edward and Kristiana play in fundraising for black soldiers during the Civil War. It was Kristiana who secured the necessary permits and rental space, but it was Bannister who organized the decoration and hospitality, reflecting not just their collaborative partnership, which seems so lasted until his death, but also the fact that they probably threw some wonderful parties. Now in the face of a rise in anti-black violence in Boston, the couple moved to Providence where their artistic work, their organizing and their community building continues. Bannister takes a studio at the wood building. He continues to mentor younger artists and is one of the founding members of RISD and the Providence Arts Society. But while Edward painted Kristiana continued his successful businesses and starts a home for the aged colored women, where Bannister also exhibits his work. Look briefly then at this photograph, it's from this scrapbook. This photograph is repeated, and in the second iteration of it in this scrapbook, we find it pasted among articles and printed reproductions of two paintings that were already in Bannister's studio according to these reports. The photograph shows Bannister at ease, pipe in hand. A few from Canvases' rest on the ground. On the wall, they seem to be tapestries and canvases. Is this his studio? A meeting of the Providence Art Club? I'm not sure, but it isn't remarkably intimate, informal view of Bannister in his world and circled on the page by his art and the voices of his contemporaries preserved in those articles. Whose visits to his studio suggest it was a place of gathering as well as work. In many ways, the organization of this page materializes to me the intellect and interdependent social, artistic and natural worlds that Edward and Kristiana might have enjoyed. While his racialized experience has never usually overtly depicted, it is not to say in his artworks. It is not to say that experiences of racial violence and discrimination were not salient to the Bannisters. One story in the scrapbook describes his anger at reading a white journalist belief that African-Americans had no capacity to produce art. Another describes the racism he faced when his paintings were, his painting under the oaks was offered, was awarded a first medal at the 1876 Centennial Exposition, but Bannister was almost not allowed to actually go and visit and accept the medal. Bannister's career in these narratives is also sometimes understood as an attempt to demonstrate black genius. And at times, his racial exceptionalism also is encoded in the articles as they describe his lack of training and as they discuss occasionally his naive or childlike feeling. Meanwhile, it's clear that in the depictions of Bannister that are pasted into this scrapbook, many of them clearly attest to his racialized features. The precarity that the Bannisters must have felt at times is not necessarily, however, readily visible in the quiet scenes he painted of New England. But it may be one reason that Bannister did find such connection with his local landscapes. As his contemporaries remembered, quote, Mr. Bannister never found it necessary to go far afield in search of subjects for his brush. He looked for beauty in the objects at hand. And now in another particularly evocative description, T. Thomas Fortune writes about seeing both Bannister and Cristiana out in the summer on sketching and walking trips. Quote, laden with baskets of flowers and leaves. He describes Bannister's love of wildflowers which he used to paint. And then which Cristiana used in mixing herbal medicine. And I showed you an advertisement earlier where that's mentioned. This knowledge she may have learned from her indigenous family. So as well as his deep love of nature, his desire to study it and to better understand its truths, it seems that the local landscapes that Bannister and were also a space of physical and psychological healing, a place of respite for both him and Cristiana. The Bannisters seemed not to be caught between two worlds then, but embedded in multiple communities. Through their differently inclined labors, they supported each other. Just as it seems, their art, politics and beliefs beliefs could sustain each other. While Bannister's attachment to the local might have stemmed from social as well as aesthetic factors, it was precisely this local knowledge, this familiarity that his contemporary is valued. They suggest that his works power is drawn, first of all, from his deep fondness, even love for the local countryside. And I'm quoting here, never before has any artist in this locality thrown upon the canvas, such restful, soulful scenes, where pasture and rocks and loralokes and swanland and drowsy cattle all combine to ultimate dreams of peace. The writers included in the scrapbook do not see his work as a touristic guide, but they see him as a guide of sorts. I began with a sense of the interdependence of Bannister's worlds because it would seem that it was his ability to see and evoke the interdependence of and within worlds, both human and nature, that his contemporaries found so valuable. His deep joy in nature translated for them into a deep local knowledge from which he could draw out four and direct viewers towards relationships, both visible and invisible, embedded within and from which these kinds of sites were composed. The beauty of his work, George Whitaker wrote, quote, lay in their suggestiveness, which set the beholders imagination at work. He gave us hints of nature not as he or we see it, but as we all desire it to be. It is Bannister's role as an interpreter that ultimately most impressed his contemporaries. The sketches contained in the scrapbook suggests something, I think, of this process. Think here of Bannister. Think of him perhaps perched on a rock or lying in the grass leaning against a tree as he sketched things like this. He creates different zones of concentration on the small page so that on the right, the image that you're seeing, there are wavy lines which stretch out as clouds. The mid ground is populated by lovely looping squiggles into spurs with the hatching of trees and rocks. While in the center, he's contoured the lines to gather blank space into a reflective surface. But perhaps best of all in the image on your right, he notes color around the scene, purple gray, green and at the top, simply light. In the image on your left, he also uses contour lines to draw out a small farmstead while again using the open space to jot down the materials and placement of its features. Other compositions vary. Some are simply charcoal forms, whose cloudy shading and twisting lines still manage to evoke a sense of organic movement. Here we see a more pronounced and finished integration of contour and shading. We can see how Bannister might have used the flat of his pencil or a piece of charcoal to investigate the effects of curescure in emphasizing the scene's stillness. Human, animal and plant life are integrated into compositions that unfold and in the image on your right hold. Each seemed to be sustained by the other. We also have examples in which Bannister used watercolour or pastel to amplify the initial contours of each zone. Here who seems to use the contour lines of his pencil for guidance, demarcating compositional moments through shading. Color however seems to be both the connective element and the substance of these sketches. A characteristic that his contemporaries also observed. He knows, wrote the artist George Whitaker again. He knows the value of deep shadows. He uses them as skillfully as a musical composer would his bass cleft. To my mind, his best color is the somewhat quieter colors that play with grays, that dance on the borderland between the grave of things and those of an extremely punctuous nature. He goes on to explain that Bannister got his picture by twisting and turning objects in his composition to suit his fancy, digesting well what he appropriated, thus, obtaining the best results. Clearly Bannister used his sketches to explore and interpret the essential harmony in what he saw, the interdependence of color, form, texture and light, which I think you can see so beautifully here where we have this sketch and then we have his notes about light and placement. These drawings are the beginning then of his exploration and experimentation. On April the 15th in 1886, a year after he painted Palmer River, Bannister addressed his colleagues at the Anne Eliza Club, a male membership only club that he also helped to found in which matters of art, culture and politics were discussed. Bannister addressed his fellow members with a lecture called, and I'm quoting the artist and his critics. This text is the only extant example we have of his personal philosophy on art, and in fact it's probably the only extant example we have of any 19th century black diaspora, artist's philosophy on art in the US. Bannister describes his artistic period in terms of an enlightenment, and I'm quoting here from him, an awakening appreciation of its value as a teacher, and it's importance as a means towards lifting us out of this low atmosphere of sorted gain and selfish ambition into one more ethereal and spiritual. The lecture is really part homily, part excoration of art critics, maybe also part rebuttal to those earlier claims I mentioned about popular conceptions of black artists lack of genius, but it is also a fascinating insight into his understanding of his role as an artist. He says the artist becomes an interpreter according to his natural powers of expression, of the infinite subtle qualities of the spiritual idea, centering in all created things, expanding for us the laws of beauty, revealing to us glimpses of the absolute idea of perfect harmony. Tracea Costia has Trace Bannister's deep engagement with German idealist philosophy, including Schiller and Hegel, as well as the transcendentalist idealism of writers like Ralph Waldo Emerson, that's for you, Horace. In keeping with many landscape painters of his time, Bannister understood the genre as a means of conveying higher truths, spiritual meanings and sentiments, embedded in and around the natural world. He understood himself moreover as an interpreter and an intermediary, but it's not that he just understands himself, he positions himself as in this role, as a guide to provide viewers with new eyes, fresh vantage points through which to see. Well, I can't extemporize further, Horace can do that, on the philosophical underpinnings of Bannister's speech. What I do want to highlight is that I think his words, like his works, do give us a deeper sense of what motivated him, and a deeper sense, perhaps, of what he might have understood as freedom, freedom at least from the constraints of the racialization and exceptionalism that he faced. In the pastoral surgeons and aesthetic explorations, he so clearly enjoyed. Just as his aesthetic philosophy offered Bannister a way to inhabit his local surroundings, these understandings of his place in the world might have offered him a different way of inhabiting his blackness. Bannister's lectures demonstrate that part of his deep love of painting was reflected in this, not just in this pleasure, but in the privilege of being an artist and interpreter. Discussing a painting called After the Shower, and this may be a study for the painting, I'm not entirely sure, that was loaned to his memorial show by a patron. One critic writes that his interpretations offer both solemnity and a higher feeling of exaltation. From their ability to, quote, raise the beholder into a realm of ideas to minister not only to the minister, not only to the intellect, which is also a gateway to the feeling within. I think this little anecdote reinforces in some ways what we know already about Bannister, that his Babison style, or Babison and Fuse style, appealed to patrons in both Boston and Providence. And we can see this, for example, in this work, which is really tiny work at the Colby Museum. This was made for Charles G. Coulter, who was a Providence art dealer, and who was one of, who was also very active in the Providence art club. But I think this quote that I just read out also gives us a sense of why his work appeals, and why he wanted his work to appeal. In this work, the gentle slopes in the foreground rock their way back through the composition, evoking the gestures of Bannister's own brush as it swept across the canvas, referencing the Babison school's emphasis on simplicity and veracity. The scene is sketchy, blending and smudging shades of color into details, cows breeding, a child watching, smoke rising. Probably unfinished, it's also, it's sketchiness also reinforces its immediacy. With rolling brushstrokes and a zigzagging movement, Bannister keeps us, keeps our vision moving between the pond, the figure, trees and sky. And as we wind our way through the painting, this sloping composition is reinforced that creates a tondo-like effect that infolds us, reflecting a harmonious arrangement of the human and natural world. It seems then in the way he drew viewers into their scenes through the fine balance of curoscuro, color, and tonality, where labor and beauty could be synthesized and the human and natural world shown in sympathetic alignment. Viewers understood Bannister's work as a work of elevation, of taking them out of the everyday by directing them towards the beauty he saw in the world around him. But in an anecdote that he shares with George Whitaker, he described his pride upon hearing that the industrialist who bought his award-winning painting under the oaks for which he won a medal and which we no longer have, he described his pride about hearing that this industrialist spent time every morning sitting in front of the painting, simply contemplating the quietness of the pastoral landscape. I think this really gives us a sense of not only of the life that Bannister's paintings had, but his own aspirations for his work and the conditions of relation he hoped they could create. Now in the context of an industrializing north and south, these scenes certainly might have offered audience's simmer spite, something nostalgic, perhaps even an antidote to counter both urban expansion and industrialization. But to be taken out of this world could also mean seeing it and knew and certainly his contemporaries seemed to share this sentiment. Seeing these local scenes through Bannister's mind's eye was an opportunity for them to see differently. Through the ways he invested quote, the commonplace objects with a weird beauty and dignity. For John Arnold, another artist from Providence and a student of Bannister's, it was his poetic feeling that inspired the way he could absorb and distill skies, rocks, trees through the Olympic of his soul and then project them and you upon the canvas. Another saw him as quote, a wakeful dreamer, a visionary. For others, it was his ability to infuse the local with the spiritual to find quote, sermons in stones that reflected at least the widower, how he was able to infuse the real with the ideal will conversely find the ideal in the real. And in doing so, draw from the outer world quote, and this is a quote, draw from the outer world and by his deep appreciation, touch the souls by representing clearly the invisible and the visible. Bannister asserts his entitlement, his right to speak about nature in ways that we perhaps have not fully acknowledged in the history of 19th century Black diaspora art. I want to reiterate that to behold what Bannister's mind's eye, a black man in late 19th century New England, beheld is not necessarily to a light race from the picture. Reporting on the first Providence Art Club exhibition in 1880, Charles Walter Stetson described a landscape that Bannister submitted called pasture, perhaps something like this, that although every day in its, or mundane in its subject, deployed he quotes a breath and vigorous vitality of color and detail that resulted in a perfectly balanced harmonious scene. It was through this synthesis he argued that viewers might understand where Bannister's genius lay in the pastoral, in quote, the everyday, toiling world of brow, of brow sweat and backache and war with elemental heaven for bread and rest. For Stetson, Bannister's interpretive genius lies in the demonstration of the interdependence and friction between human and natural world, an interdependence that Bannister notices because of his deep love for nature. And certainly in many of his pastoral scenes, he includes features, a curving pathway or horizon, small outcrops of trees, gentle beasts of burden that kind of gently reveal the lands uses as sites of agricultural labor. This is also not to say that he shied away from grappling with New England's own histories of toil as your own former own, Goindalindu boy, a sure demonstrated in her really groundbreaking article. Bannister demonstrated certainly his awareness and reveal the centrality of slavery to his work. And in the case of this work in particular, I wonder too if he's, or we could think about the ways he might be thinking about sharecropping and its relationship to Rhode Island because tantalizingly, and I need to do my work on this, there's a sliver of an article in the scrapbook in which Bannister really seems to be commenting and decrying the practice of sharecropping in the South, to T. Thomas Fortune, who also wrote a book about land and labor in post-reconstruction, US and in particular in the South. So we might think about how Bannister married to a woman whose family were descendants of enslaved, people interpreted these pastoral landscapes to demonstrate another kind of interdependence between the North and the South, that is what contemporaries could not or simply decline to see. If as Bannister describes in his lecture, his role as interpreter was finding the ideal in the real, we're using the real with the ideal. Landscapes such as this, I think only reinforce his deep knowledge of his local surroundings and their significance. They might also suggest his commitment to exploring what was then the dialectic between the real and the ideal. That is, we can also understand his interpretation of things like this that suggest the mutuality of North and South in the US as unfolding from his deep appreciation of and connection to the land, as well as his own political activism, the two are also interdependent, one need not erase the other. To make this point another way, T. Thomas Fortune makes very special mention in his article about Bannister, about Edward's purchase of a very fine sailing yacht, not long after moving to Rhode Island. He goes on to describe, all his leisure hours were spent sailing around Newport and adjacent points for pleasure. He is naturally fond of the sea and is as thoroughly at home on water as on land. Now there's a much longer history of Black folk finding freedom on the water that I cannot tell here, but beyond his sojourns on the land, it really was the ocean that Bannister loved the most. His sketchbooks include several drawings of sailboats and yachts, interiors, annexed areas, and there are consistent observations in this scrapbook that describe the pleasure and sheer joy he found on the water. In a poem, you'll energizing him, Bannister after his death, will you be Smith-lemented friends? We will never see him more in his favorite haunts on Narragansett's shore. Now in Christina Sharpe's L.A.J. text in the wake, the ship, of course, indexes the processes by which captive Africans and their descendants are rendered as property. And Bannister himself, remember, had been a merchant navy cook during the first half of the 19th century when ships holding enslaved people continued to cross the Atlantic. Given his activism, his knowledge of New England's coastal ports reliance on slavery, it is somewhat jarring, perhaps, to ask that Bannister felt most free on the sailboat, on a ship, that it was the days before age affected his mobility when he could sail along the areas coastal shores that his, and I'm quoting here, a cup was full. According to the articles in the scrapbook, and from his many paintings, we know that while sailing around the coast, Bannister sketched continuously, making cloud and sea studies that described the changing ecology of the area, as well as its local forms of industry. Newport and Jamestown, which were popular resort towns by the end of the 19th century for both white and black communities, were also favorites of Bannisters. And we think this might be him at work in Newport. Here, however, in this small study of Jamestown, and again, this is just to give you a sense of scale, of how small of, it's around the same size as the work you have up in the museum right now. Here in this small study of Jamestown, we're invited to walk alongside the shoreline. We follow the Curving Cliffs, approaching a pier where sailboats are mowed. Bannister has created a carefully harmonized color palette, light brown seaweed, egg shell sand, green tuffs on the shore, rying with the green hues of the cliffs and track the changing colors of the sky. The darkening from pale pink to a grey blue. Although no human figures roam, the sailboats suggest this balance between a world of human travelers and the moods of the natural world. Neither is overwhelmed by the other. We're left with the really embodied experience of seeing and moving through nature, that at least to me demonstrates Bannister's grounding in the localized geographies of his experience. While it is tempting to think about the coastline and its lateral characteristics as a metaphorical kind of in-between space, Bannister seems more interested in it as a site of connection, where the push and pull of water and land form their own unique ecological zone. I'm drawn, for instance, to the seaweed and tuffs of grass that are scumbled and streaked that match the work surface of the sky. It is possible to imagine their leathery texture to see the wind through them further down the shore, to smell them as they cling together in damp clumps. Perhaps Bannister is more of his boat, perhaps he's walked across the shore, perhaps he also collected some clumps of grass and seaweed to take back to Kristiana. In his handling of the scene, it is at the shoreline, at the Torral Zone, that where we find the site of recognition, where we see the artist at work and his autograph and share in his embodied vision. Creating these shared visual experiences in his interpretation of the local landscape, Bannister also visualizes a mode of affiliation, or belonging, based not on possession, but on intimacy and care. Perhaps he or she offers us, or at least offers us the opportunity to imagine to imagine another kind of black ecocrysticism, beyond those framed by landscape steep histories and attachments to the plantation and forms of extraction. I don't have any clear answers yet of how that might look, but perhaps beginning from Bannister's point of view suggests a sense of interdependence and relationality. Bannister's paintings mod a scale and his unattended scenes have sometimes deflected us from more studied observation. He does not make it, for example, into Elaine Locke's legacy of the insensural ancestral arts, an essay that arguably begins black diaspora art history with Henry Ossawad-Tana. James Porter begins chapter three of modern Negro art with Bannister, quoting from John Nelson Arnold, to describe Bannister as an interpreter of natural beauty. His admiration for Bannister lies less with his technique, which he finds a little better than average, perhaps because Bannister wasn't able to travel abroad, and more with his feeling for and perception of nature. It's an admiration shared, as we've seen, by audiences of Bannister's time. Porter builds up a picture of Bannister that distinguishes between his contemporaneous context and the impressions his works might make on more modern or contemporary audiences. Cedric Dover, in his 1960 study, moves further, I think, noting that despite a lack of patronage, he was deeply moved by a deeply rooted love for woods and water, of which landscape painting was a part. And Dover goes on to say, it is for this reason that he became the first African-American artist to earn recognition as an American regional painter of consequence. Dover also observes very pointedly that Bannister aimed to prove his artistic chops without an emphasis on what Dover calls, absurdly, sorry, without an emphasis on what are so absurdly called racial themes, end quote. In 1876, Robert Douglas, the first African-American artist that we know of to attend the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art who lived in Philadelphia, described seeing Edward Mitchell-Bannister's painting under the oaks, the one that won the award, on display at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in the City. While the exhibition was located in Philly, it was also, as we know, really an international event, promoting and newly reconstructing and industrializing United States to the world. Although this painting is now lost, Douglas's observation is one of the few we have. He describes, it was a quiet pastoral scene, a shepherd and sheep beneath the fine group of oaks. It's much admired and it gave me great pleasure to find that it is one of the really maritalious works that have gained a medal. To me, it recalls some of the best efforts of Constable, the great English landscape painter, end quote. It's really fascinating actually to think of how paintings by John Constable circulated among black American communities in the 1870s, but that's in the side. While the recognition of this national award was one marker of Bannister's significance, and clearly it was celebrated by black communities beyond Red Island. What's also clear from Douglas's description is that this painterly comparison between Duncan's in and Constable lent a very particular significance to Bannister's work for his readers that amplified his importance as an artist on a national and on international stages. And in fact, because of that exposition, Bannister was also set to be included in what would have been the first Afro-American art museum that was imagined in the late 1860s and 1870s. There's much more to be said about these historiographies of black diaspora or more specifically African-American art. Ideally, this might consider not only their specific historical context, but also address the crucial question of what black art means and does not just for the fear that large, but for a diverse community of viewers as specific shifts and turns. For communities of art historians, Bannister has come into view at different times and in different ways. Yet what I hope, shown you, is some of the ways that Bannister saw himself and how, for his contemporaries, he was never out of sight. Thank you. APPLAUSE Thank you, Anna. I see our program assistance getting ready with microphones. We have time for a couple of questions. And so if you have a question, please raise your hand and our wonderful PAs will come to you. Thank you. Let's see. Hello, Oliver Sirplus here. I believe you used the word, anxious before. OK. Was that intended to be a figurative commentary towards how people were dismissive of his work or just literally to refer to the oily nature of the work? That was from a quote from George Wydeka and he's talking about kind of the mix of color that Bannister's making. So it's probably because he's talking about the grave of colors and something more of Anker's is probably about the oiliness. Thought so. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you so much for this beautiful talk. I was really struck by your use of the scrapbook and the way in which I think you brought out a kind of interdependency of the page of these scrapbook pages between the photographs and the texts and so I started to think about the scrapbook page as its own kind of landscape. And so I was wondering what you mentioned that the scrapbooks had works from after his death. Do we know whose hands the scrapbook passed into? And was he first using it as a sketchbook and then someone else did the scrapbooking or do we have a sense of if his wife took it on? That's a great question. And I don't know that the I haven't, it's all online, it's all digitized. I haven't actually felt it in my hands. But it looks to be that it was a book that was then collected, so the sketches are then collected into a scrapbook because there's multiple pages. So it looks to be like a curated set, or as I think the idea of a landscape or kind of an exhibition and its own right. And we're not sure, I mean, it could have been Cristiana, although she was not well or that well at the time of his death. So it may be people from the Providence Art Club or some like, you know, because George Whitaker has mentioned a lot in there, it could be his friends. But that's something that really needs more work. But I think it is an amazing kind of landscape in its own way. So yeah, thank you for noticing. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you so much. The title of your wonderful talk, and of course, the fact that he died in the midst of an evening prayer meeting, does raise the question of the significance of his faith. Can you discuss what we know of his faith and of the ways in which his faith is reflected in his work? Yes. I mean, I think he died while at an evening prayer meeting, essentially. And we know that he and Cristiana were deeply committed to the members of the Tramont Baptist Church, I think. And I think that quote that I read out from his lecture gives us a sense of that. Because I mean, Tosia Costeer talks about it in the context of transcendentalism. But I think his idea of elevation and of the ways in which his work had this, to him, anyway, this sense of being not just morally, but spiritually elevating. And I think finding these truths, these religious truths in nature was very important to him. And I didn't, I haven't gone into it in detail here, mostly because I'm using what's in this scrapbook, which tends to emphasize his faith and his incorporation into faith communities rather than necessarily reading that sort of Christian spirituality into his paintings. But I do think that he sees the two as certainly interconnected. That his role as an intermediary or interpretive guide is also a role to elevate, to bring viewers closer to the divine in a certain way. And so I think that's certainly a part of it. Yeah, thank you. Well then, thank you all so much for coming. Another round of applause for our speaker. I should say, and I should just say this at the beginning, much of this lecture is also really an honor of Horace, because I spent many, many years maybe looking at his Instagram pictures of walks along the shoreline. But I can't tell you that that gave me a certain kind of commission to think about this in new ways. So also for Horace, thank you. Thank you. Thank you.",
10,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:797572?width=3000&height=3000,Deutschland wird deutscher XLI/92,Katharina Sieverding,1992,"My name is Lynette Roth and I'm the Dymler Benz Associate Curator of the Bush Risinger Museum and I'm pleased to welcome you to tonight's artist talk lecture which is the second in our series this season and our focus for artist talk series this year is Art in Public Space and we have invited contemporary artists from Latin America, Europe and the United States to discuss work that either engages viewers in a public setting or explores the very idea of the public and the public role of art and the artist. And tonight I am very pleased to welcome Düsseldorf based artist Katarina Zieferding to the Harvard Art Museums. Since the late 1960s Katarina Zieferding has consistently pushed the boundaries of the photographic medium and her use of large scale images, extreme closeups and techniques such as solarization, color filters or composite imagery. A student of Joseph Boyz, Zieferding's artistic practice, photography, film and installation addresses the relationship of the individual in society and often involves the artist herself as its primary protagonist. Typically three meters high and roughly four or five meters long, Katarina Zieferding's photographic statements often tryptics demand a public kind of attention and she increasingly employs projection to expand the field of vision and experience and incorporate the viewer's body into the work of art itself. Her artwork also participates directly in public discourse, often outside of the space of the gallery. So I'm going to go ahead and stop there so that we might hear from the artist about her extraordinary career and the intersections of her work with public space. So please welcome Katarina Zieferding. I was studying together with Palermo and Imic Noble and Rana Giza Yorke Imendorf. Then I still try to do sort of conventional drawings and stuff. I then switched a year later to a situation of more communication. This was a tent that was also installed outside of the Düsseldorf Academy and I was palm reading for visitors who came to this exhibition after the end of the academic year 68. And these portraits, this was the last sort of sculptural object that I did. This is Imic Noble and me. The times went on and the whole discussion within the academy was getting more and more political. This was the everyday practice in womb 20 next to where I was working, discussing the threefold model of society. Let's say the splitting of power in between cultural part and the economical part and justice. So this is the idea whether one can break through these normal policies that are always dominated by economics. And this was the great issue of Joseph Boyz then. So we were discussing in a so-called Ringersprachin into the night about these issues and then unfortunately it was stopped. These practice in May 69 when these teachings and these discussions were no longer bearable for the academy and for the colleagues of Joseph Boyz. And so he was asked to finish this political work with the students. There was no reason to finish it. One has to consider that in the same time there were this student revolt in Germany when the Onozark was already killed in summer 67 boys founded the students party and so on and so on. So why doing just pure academic work while the whole situation was to reform? So we continued but then by law the police stopped at the work. At that moment we had some Danish guests like Fluxos people like Henning Christian and also Björn Norgert, a Danish artist who see him with the long hairs. So they had to get everything together the techniques and finish their presentation. Then there were the cut between outside and inside so we had to be outside of the academy and the police was inside. When I tried to documentate it they had all these pipes and knew that it is hard to get them in a row. So the whole lessons and discussions continued outside of the academy. You see all these issues about work and money and death and so on and so on which are still I think very actual. I cannot translate everything but I think you see the intention and boys were there every day from morning to the night talking to passengers and casual passes by and people of the Sudaf. You see a lot of pamphlets and papers were written and the academy was completely closed no way to be in it. I just show you these situations because that was the moment when I switched from doing traditional techniques and painting or sculpture into photography. I wanted to be a testimony I could not go into a studio and be there alone and be genius creator. I wanted to document all these processes so that was a first step by photography into a public practice. So this is another public work. These are the four artists, co-students of mine who were in the class who committed suicide or died. Everyone has another biography. The last one is Palermo that was a bit later but when I was asked it was when he just died this is a building where we did a show on this whole past years. It was very important that those people in the Sudaf get to know about these artists inside we had an exhibition that we did together with Joseph Poise. This is a discussion these posters or public poster walls. So we ask you what kind of art you like or what you favorise and please come and discuss it with us in the Kunsthalla. Then here you see some plan that I did and I have integrated this drawing so that you get an idea how I came to the big format so this was by projection. So I could then go with a projector, a slide projector into a space and test it within a space. This is a beginning of a writer series called Transformer and it was another issue for me after taking protocols of all these sort of collective processes and demonstrations and corporations to ask myself who am I and how do I perform and am I present as a becoming female artist within that generation. I was surrounded by all these strong genius like let's say basilitz and Luperts and Immendorf and Poilker and so on and so on. They were all painters so I took the chance by this medium of photography and it's for me a medium of analysis and reflection. So to work with these images about myself and also about the issue of genders. So what is the construction of the representation of yourself as a female in that time and within all the other representations that were in the public. The Transformer is the idea that I combined a female portrait with a male portrait. I added a slide or female and male portrait, put it one on the other and then I reproduced the view as a new face, a new creation and that was for me the first statement that you incorporate both sex. You must imagine at the same time it was a very radical feminism excluding the male and all these things and I could not follow that. So I was including the male thinking if I want to force a changement, cannot only have to do with my own sex but also with a male. So I did it visually. This is Transformer. It's an analog, the nine channel projection and it's changing in a certain resin and a space for contemporary art in Berlin, Kunstwerker and gives you an idea about how I got Nira and Nira to the big enlargement of photographic work. That's another interface with the public. I did some circus jobs and parat and open air. I mean we were moving from one town to the other. It interested me a lot. I did many different roles like the Lightning Venus, so growing electricity is from my body and so I was sort of glowing and all these things. This is another act from this circus with a knife throwing things. So this is eight projections. I wanted to get out of this one projection into a multiple projection and screening. So this is the next step into the big format. These are friends. This is a hand of Jack Smith for example. So I'm helping him with the costume. No, it gets further into the laboratory work and this is a projector. This is cosmetic. My partner is still today and this is for example the partner he offered the male face for the Transformer series. So we were constructing a projector from different parts of a vacuum cleaner to cool it and we had no money to buy a new big projector. But it worked. So now you see the first big piece from 74, 75. It was a strange friendship. It was a friendship between computer and volcano. Everyone can read it or imagine what it is meaning. But I think one can sort of see it. So that was the first big one. This is Francois Lombard in Milan. It's just paper and tucked on the wall and for me it was really important to break through this normal format of photography. I was never in this Canon La Polar photography. So I wanted to do something in that time that could match or continue pop art and any big important image or painting or advertisements. Here you see I took one that you saw before and I made a montage in advertisement spaces and this is the last medium before the point of sale because this was the first gallery show I did with Conrad Fisher and the other invitation for this show. So here it is Conrad Fisher Space with the projections and that's also Conrad Fisher. The next thing is another public space. It is a bank in Düsseldorf and I was asked to do a statement in 76 and I was already very interested to go to China and I will not say that I was ever a Maoist but this was in the air. Somehow you could feel that China would become very important. You could feel the breakdown of the Maoist cultural revolution and so on and so on. So I thought I put it into a bank because then China was still not having any credit relationship with the Western capitalist world. But I must say this was not installed for a long time because the clients of the bank is a big bank in Düsseldorf. They said what are you doing now here? This is propaganda for the communists and so it was taken down, it was destroyed but then I was already in America because I studied, I got the chance to study at the Whitney Museum, the ISP and later at the new school for social research. So I was then New York and I heard that they censored it and they put a Christmas tree instead in front of this wall. This is another work that I did in America. This was the headline of the Los Angeles Daily Paper and maybe some of you know this film, The Boston Strangler. This was the time when I was in New York. There was this phenomenon of super killers. So this was the super killer from Boston. He strangled a lot of nurses. That was 76. And then I saw somehow this was for me a climax of Cold War in Nevada. They were training against Soviets. This was in the air, this phenomenon of super killing and all tensions. Then that was a Cumenta 6 and 77. They asked me to do a big piece there. That was the first media document in Kassel in Germany but it was all very historical work and this small size and then you that I'm not working in this conventional size before they came specially to New York say what are you going to do and I said well I do a new work, an actual statement. And when I came with it there was a sort of problem because oh the content of this image and of this piece and grim games, Hammond and so on and so it was scary and then I said come on you know you invited me. Then I paid a construction firm overnight so they came and we put it 9 meter high. You see they were not trained with the paper so it was all grushed. But finally it was installed and it was there. I have the right to do it. Then they came along a very nice photography at what Quinn he is the Picasso photographer and he did a series of photographs about this situation and he sent them to me. So that was not the first time that I was a document. I was already on the documentary five with Haraj Zeman and we had not these sort of problems but in the canon of this officially photography show this was obviously too extreme from the format, from the content from the whole attitude but I didn't take it down and it was there the whole show. You can imagine this big format to really articulate statements that are very in the collective consciousness and perception very known but I thought then within the fine arts field and this context it was not easy to get along and also I had a lot of problems with all this interesting deals for like Fisher and so on because it's smaller we cannot sell this format and I said no this is my artistic issue and commitment and I have to do it like this. So that was then that I worked for nearly 20 years without any bigger merchandise connection and gallery and so on and so on because this is then a consequence if you do what you have to do as an artist and then as a female artist it was not easy. This is a statement about the lack out night in New York that is 77. This is a headline from maybe Newsweek that night I was on the roof of the fine arts building on Hudson and it was like a orient the whole New York no light but just the skyline and especially when the day came it was really like completely changed and so in that moment this photo was taken and I mean the Great White Wagels Black has also not only that it became dark but you know how the persecution of all this lutery and the blacks and all this so it has an ambivalent meaning. Then the interest to auto-China was also a very long preparation so first I did it let's say conceptually I developed together with Klaus Metig this China America for Channel Slide Show on one side Chinese images and others and we traveled with this show through many art departments it was part of our visiting artists lecture through the whole country so that was a good chance to talk about and to give an idea about the dimension of the research on China and America of course the images about China were from the China review most of them so the propaganda material that you were able to get pulled off. The sound on this piece was a soundtrack of hearing of Bertolt Brecht in front of the committee or un-American activities. I found this record in New York and it's a brilliant sound because all the doubts that you have China America in that time and about these images and sort of the self-destructive and the positive about all these Chinese masses and laughing and you know so it's a really interesting work and it's interesting to see these days because yeah somehow it changed a lot and a sound that would break it's somehow better than his dramas when he is talking and answering the questions of these McCarthy people so this is also from this. Here you see one of those interests is another big piece it's today a stedalag integrated in their collection even in the winter cold the diverse work 20 meter underwater so it gives you an idea about this propaganda and this idea of just working under any conditions and so on and so on so I took this military woman and me beside as a also lonely fighter in more this cowboy style this was in Yugoslavia the scene and I did a film there then so this dish out to me of polarizing world views which is often in images of that period yeah I still like the work it's somehow makes me think what is the development of the role of female presenters. Here you see it is at a folkwang museum in 1777 this is the first show of more than five pieces that I did in this old part of the folkwang museum my idea was that you cruise through all these spaces and they were sort of surrounded if you have many multiple films so it's a bit like a movie set up so that's why it is quite high that was the real struggle with the museum people oh it's too high and I said no it has to be like this because oh one had practice with this big form and only me so it was interesting so this is a Puerto Rican I took any research in Puerto Rican clubs and social clubs you see a bit maybe the strategy of these installations finally we got to China it was 78 it took us two years a lot of examinations a lot of applications to explain what we want to see and also we asked for permission to shoot with 60 millimeters there and so we were of course very much inspired by those films of George Evans this Dutch filmmaker and the great supporter of these Chinese ideas and some films last 12 hours so we got there in 78 in October and it was really very very interesting today this is for example an installation later in Shanghai Biennale they invited us with this film that was Elana Heiss from MoMA PS1 again it was really a hesitation whether the state's committee would allow to show this film because it was from the 70s and it was no more allowed in the public about those times and even with the students I was teaching three times in Shanghai that's time around 2000 even there I did it for the students and it was a real tension because they should not see what was going on then this committee came and I said I show film here and please sit down do a private view for you and you cannot imagine there were a little club under themselves and they were just crying these were the good old times it's all about a time when it had it completely under control the masses and Mao just died and all this then I did another work out of it that was the show in the state like from other museum in Anton we have friends all over the world again it's a much of the morning exercise of the Chinese soldiers and this was only one international club in Beijing in the lobby we have friends all over the world and imagine this is a work that went later to Ai Wei Wei into the museum of order so it's now there he liked a lot this work and he understood completely the message so you see strange enough I had to deal with all these troops this was a rough time of the Red Army action in Germany and this is the G-SK 9 this time I took this image of this shooting specialist from a German magazine Speaker and this was Battlefield Germany I like this just so I cut it I produced the color analog through a spot because it's purple there's a color of cruelty then still I left all these materials of the photo paper and how it was produced we still did it by hand in a machine called Boobinwa so you had to roll it like and force it so it was all done in our own laboratories this is a piece in the new National Gallery in Gullin this work I myself like very much it's unresistible historic streaming so it is a man who is sort of sinking in the mud and believe it or not it is Charlie Chaplin in one of his best films great dictator yeah this is a piece from 1980 called Rohrat this is a series of six pieces it's still called war I reacted to this incident in the Rocky Mountains atomic center of your country I think some hammer fell down and so the computers showed us signals and they thought oh this is a tech from the Soviets already so what so it was shot before initiation of an atomic reaction and this inspired me to this work it is this entrance to the atomic center it's still existing I'm always researching about what happens to my image locations and this woman in front is a rotation from a film of a cock tour of he and it's Maria Sazarez and this other woman is also out of this film when she is the impersonator of this and she's giving the commands I thought it can only be a woman that can protect this balance this is a death candidate so he has this other little animal in within a glass and found French in a magazine the whole color I mean it's really really glowing and this is special about this work that all colors are through analog really strong spotlights one color after the other and then you had to cover one color and students of mine think today oh this is easy it's just digitally done but no it's all 1980 by laboratory processes I took then this curved so then it gets dark it's another step into this idea of inferno for example 4 by 6 meter these images these photographs the last buttons are pressed what the command for the bomb fall of Hiroshima this is Ilona Gay I spent some times because of teaching was in Japan was there in Hiroshima and so on and so on in the time I was dealing with this super weapons and I like this sort of darkening tool here this is coming from an optical that I it not use you have the mask you take it away and then you get this it's a whole is an interpretation I loved it this is Martin Gladbach the Reiberk Museum this is about 7 meter by or so and here you see again my favorite work it is combined with a lot of portrait series around and always also in the installation reflecting the individual situations of an individual towards these political metaphors this is again 1980 the cooling pool of a first nuclear factory in Great Britain then it is combined with a radiological layer of someone who has cancer so I family wise my father was radiologist so maybe that's why I like to analyze and use photography or any layer to get an diagnosis this is what I always asking myself working so many decades with photography what does it mean so I always question the media where does it come from and where do we get all these high tech tools from mostly it's all invented for the military projects so this is maybe the same in medicine any illness is like an enemy and so I studied medicine first is image producing techniques in medicine and they really say you when they discover something most of you know about the treatment that then follows and the whole machinery that you get into it and so on and so on these are questions that move me and that is why I work with a lot of materials of a diagnosis of the human body here you see boys that was in his last months in Japan I think was his last tour abroad and so he's talking I use this sort of framing because the typical technique of boys so he was always interested in this sort of presentation of his works I wanted to frame in within his own techniques this was the last show in Lindberghaus in Munich the homage boys when he already had died this is another bank that I was asked to do a public work for and they had this column so I did this work in behind actually is the same war where some years before the Mao was but now they like this much better and they even gave me a prize they bought the work and so on but the shocker was maybe important for them many years before so these columns if you would put these together you get this whole image in the background and this is also an interesting technique it is pigment on metal one can say a bit like a silkscreen technique in that time I was asked to do some work in museums and more public spaces with a lot of daylight so I developed this technique printing on metal and with colors they do the traffic signs and some of these works still in the sun and since years and it's fine so you know the problem about photography and the light so this was a period when I changed to this sort of techniques this is another very public space it was in 1990 when slowly there was a move from the capital Bonn to Berlin so the whole government moved to Berlin and they needed some artwork to regain this very high-stask boiler you know history and so they needed a work and it was a wet-be-wap so I could do this special statement it's nine meters or something and it is a surface of the sun with the corona it's a spine in the middle and another layer of a cancer situation I thought if they go back into this building which has such a catastrophic history these 12 years of fascism and cancer is a phenomenon that you're not immediately and feel so I thought it's a metaphor for them if they look at it and think there's always this danger of this association of the social body then I asked to publish or the installation the fate and the whole biographies of all the political persons how they were killed and what happened to them there were a lot of research so I made three big books of those who were prosecuted, who were killed and those they don't know what so that the relatives put go to this place and look in the box and there's a communication with this political past and for the future of the German government in Berlin in this building to have it all communicated and it is still there now it is a big lounge so this was a space where a shiderman called the republic in the 20s the shiderman zahl and so you see the three books there unfortunately it is now on the opposite and I think he is now a restaurant or so as it goes then this is 1992-1993 there was this large museum director Rudy Fuchs and he asked me to join a group show to do work for public spaces he invited all those well-known artists American European and so but I was the only female artist and I said well I like to do a very enigmatic image for that moment and so I came to this after this reunion the xenophobia in Germany grew very much so Germany gets more German is this quote and you see I took then from this knife throwing situation being like a victim or so it was an intuition to do it like this I was the only one that was censored all the other artists could do their sculptures in this region around Stuttgart, Kulturregion Stuttgart this was the only one that they did not want to publish or to be in this 18 cities then there were the young very seen student Laus Biesenbach who saw that whole discussion that I had on TV with all these people in this 18 cities and then he said I want to bring it to Berlin and so he made it possible that it was then published on 700 public spaces in the center of Berlin and also into the highways and overnight it was a real sensation in Berlin this was one of the most scandalous works in public that I ever did because a lot of reactions and turned down and it had a real big reaction this sentence Germany becomes more German you have to get your own decision to it I mean after the reunions this whole disaster of the fascism and to end it in a way and so on and so on here are some works that I did for a big hotel in Berlin these are these light boxes so it's just to show you another public space this is done from a film that I did in 69 live deaths and so I thought the huge 300 or more images in this live boxes so I went to the whole film and took one this what you see this sort of graphic is another medical test it's a blood test called crystallization and behind you see again this golden faces that are obviously often integrated so here you see what I mean with the public it's a big gazometer in Oberhausen where they took this warge bit where the coal mines so this is a left over huge building and so I did these statements this is a consummlung not as fun in Düsseldorf just to give an idea about to deal with this sort of cedar but normally it's never really empty but this was my condition I said to Armin's writer I don't want any walls separating the whole space so just like they said no never someone did it and only a sculptor I think maybe it was Richard Sarah so he did it and I said I know it was function and I think it did quite well and he was also very happy with it this is all in the same show this is a called Starfleet Back Block it's the work from also 69 about the resistance I think he's one of the best known who organized this resistance so I just used the name for these sort of portraits and yeah it's an important work for me this is a Luxembourg headquarters bank too this is a detail from the German Pavilion in 1997 which I shared together with Gerhard Mertz and this series is called Stack Builder and Stack Builder is also a process of blood test this also in the German Pavilion it is this typical confrontation between Israel and Palestinian so this is the Deutsche Guggenheim it was a show in the same year 1997 so I built these walls in the middle of this recall and installed these portraits on this ultramarine wall painting I always try to do within a space installation and with the work so that it makes sense and that it makes clear why let's say agents within a space so this is for me the idea also of media and especially of photographic media this is the Ludwig Museum in Budapest you see always I try to use a space in a different way within this continuation of the blue color it's very early portrait this was a big show at the Städelag Museum in Amsterdam just to show you how I take the portrait outside of the museum and try already then to correspond and communicate with the artwork to inspire them to come to into the museum this is also Berlin you see a same work but another size it is a headquarters of the Ditzett Bank at the Paris Applates behind the Brandenburg tour to this famous building where Frank Ogiery made the architecture and built this strange space inside and they liked to have it this tour like a at the entrance it's again back to some projective work it's a film I did a world line about the production and the processes how I construct layers as a film this is export 2000 in Nova this is a church with a special meaning it's a black was from Mallevich with this known image of mine this is during the art fair art basil I did these symbolic works that is now another complex of works in Städel-Ovo in Naples I then was working with a collection of of Gangöte and I could choose favorites that I was interested in from his own natural science collection and I was interested to go along with him on his ideas of Vietamophosis or the four natural regions of minerals and plants the animals and the human beings so all this this idea of reflection that one is reflected in the other and in a human being incorporates all these other regions of plants animals and minerals so that was the idea that I took these elements out of these different works and images so it was reflecting one in the other so this is a more object-like installation to make this idea more clear and to move in between and also to reflect yourself within this metaphor for this idea this is a work in metro and Naples beginning 2000 so you always see this interface with reflection and so on and so on outside inside so this again are sort of cuts out of this metamorphosis whole imagery and also this black and red has a whole symbolic this idea is from 1980 it's a body photogram so then I wanted to combine movies films with photographic work and I started to project this photograph so this why I showed it before and then you see it as a projection this is Paris metro I did this as an advertisement work and I think whenever you deal with advertisement you have to know why you do it this is what I learned from Joseph Boyce when he made this advertise was whiskey and so so you always should explain or you should think about this was with Puma this sport company I got then a lot of money for my students to invest it in a special light check technique which could not ever be affordable for the university so this is why I did this sort of advertisement and and I would never get into the situation of such big thing you know and I think I liked it with this double deck of buses this is another way in Italy very famous fashion anyhow this is a depletor bankrupt so it is a title of a very critical magazine that John Hartfield orthodix and these guys did and it was another idea I wanted to do it's in eclipse so you see now as a poster also in different places again in Berlin it's another work for MoMA as a folia space in the MoMA this cultural palace in Berlin that is taken down for a new castle that they want to build and so these are the rest of the emblem of this hammer and sickle and so on and so I thought it might be a good idea that one day it will be shown in the MoMA so I sometimes I do sort of montage with institutional public spaces that I'm really interested in so this is what I told in the beginning Geisteslim, Wurzeln, Wretslim so this threefold splitting of power and so this idea which is still an utopia so this I was working at the only private university we have in Germany and Hardiker I did fundamental teaching there and so you see a little bit of his works this was the poster I did it was in Odessa it was everywhere in the world so this is Art Goes Highling Dumb I did this poster when there were this G8 summit on word economics another one I did a 200 million dollar against the wall so it happened in the hunger it was just constructed but some little technical mistake and this whole thing crashed against the wall and I was asked to do a big thing in the streets of Arte-Baser and I thought it's a nice sort of image for the Arte-Faire this is the gallery Thomas Schulte in Berlin at some point I stopped transforming any photographic matrix in the paper and I only projected the last statue I would have done I thought maybe it is nice to have it just as a stick and no more framing and depot and all these problems installing heavy so this is one of the examples so this is a test cut it's one of the later works I did so when you do an enlargement you do this test strife not to spoil the whole big size so I made a montage out of this test cuts you see now in a whole space 1,800 different images run in an h-channel installation in a random program to how the protagonist and the whole people from the artwork of friends or Arte scenery is connected and so it's unpredictable so it's great mobilization to read and to perceive Arte this is a transformation from this black and white what you saw into another abstract program it's with some of my students so it has more planetarian sort of atmosphere so we had to talk within it and I liked then besides this exact black and white this all over sort of projection so then I started to again going back to this sun which is one of the first titles of any work I did was looking at the sun at midnight so again and again I come back to the sun and so I animated materials from NASA within this film and now I'm working on the portrait of the sun from January 2010 until next year of a blue sun because this is my last sentence to you looking at the sun at midnight means that in the old sun mysterious in Egyptian times some could imagine the sun through the earth so I was always fascinated by this process and then the earth would appear to them complementary so let's say maybe blue this has to do with my whole idea on the media of photography and film and so on and so on because this transformation and looking through things and thinking about what we do in between earth and sun thank you",

Hobbs,2020-2021,"Hi everyone and welcome to the opening of the Special Exhibition Latoya M Hobbes its time. This event marks the beginning of the scholarship and academic discourse around Hobbes' work that will take place here at Harvard while the show is on view. Professor Jones, Kayla Jackson and Latoya Hobbes have prepared every date remarks to initiate our conversation today and to jumpstart the work we will all do collectively in our shared conversations and reflections on the prints titled Carving Out Time. So let's begin. Our first speaker today is Javana Jones who is an assistant professor of African American literature and culture at Boston College. She teaches and researches black visual culture, black feminist criticism and the built environment. Her writing has been published in aperture, souls, Kalaloo, Southern cultures and by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. Javana is currently working on a book entitled The Last Thanksgiving at West Fretland Square. It tells the story of her grandmother and 11 other elderly black women who fought to save their brownstone apartment building in the midst of Boston's gentrifying south end in the 1980s. Can't wait to read that. She has also worked on the visual and architectural study of black women's rooming houses across the United States, homes that were organized at the turn of the 20th century to house black women migrating to new cities for work, education and fresh beginnings. Javana is the recipient of fellowships from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Edmund J. Safra Center for Ethics and Dartmouth College. She holds her PhD in MA from Harvard University and her BA from Emory University. Please join me in welcoming Professor Jones to the podium. I'm just going to say this, my heart is beating out of my chest and it's weird because I went here for many years. So I'm like, this is home. Why is my heart beating out of my chest? I realize this is the first time I've actually had to talk about an artist work in front of the artist, not just the artist, her partner, not just her partner, they're two children. And so this is why I work on our ancestors. And as much as I love contemporary art, this is new for me. And so I want to frame this as I told you, Latoya earlier, that this is a meditation on I think reflection with how I felt when I be held your work last week. So thank you Elizabeth for this invitation and early conversations about Latoya's work over Zoom and during install. Thank you Kayla for being my art history homey and an ongoing thought partner in black feminist art. And thank you again Latoya, who I refer to you as Hobbs for the rest of this. For your generosity of skill and intimacy in your work, I'm honored to be in conversation with you about it. When I enter the gallery to see Hobbs monumental prints based on her woodcuts, I shrink. The precision of Latoya Hobbs hand overwhelmed me. I tried to describe the sensations my older sister jazz on FaceTime yesterday. I tried to capture the sheer volume of marks and carvings required to replicate and reimagine her family's living spaces and routines. Okay so on the video they showed, I started. She's like right in front of the wood, face right there, has this little scalpel tool she uses to carve each mark out of the wood. All of them jazz, all the marks. I repeat shaking the phone. I remember Hobbs has collaborators of course, so multiple hands made this work possible. From her partner, artist, Eris and Jack, to her kids, to her printers from Big Ink, many hands were involved. Still, the image I hold close is that still from the video. Hobbs face so close to the material, the smell and taste of dust and ink. The artist speaks to us over the studio footage. Just as working people, parents, whatever your walk of life is, she says, we all have to have these days in negotiations where we ask, how am I going to get all of these things done with the time that I have? Carving out time is a series of scenes depicting slices of this family's life, the time they make for each other and spend together. But carving out time is also Hobbs offering, from the sacred time she spends with herself within and close to the work. That we might recognize a black woman's household work as both life sustaining and creative was precisely what Alice Walker wanted for her own mother. In her seminal 1972 essay in search of our mother's gardens, Walker writes about the creative life force of black mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers, exploited for their domestic labor and leaving their artistic marks, quote, in the only material she could afford and in the only medium her position in society allowed her to use, end quote. She saw how this bird and surfaced in her sharecropper mother in fields from before sun up to late night. She writes that her mother never had a moment to sit down undisturbed, to peruse her own private thoughts. Something always interrupted her, either work or the inquiries of her children, Walker remembering that she's one of them. So Walker went in search of the secret of what fed her mother from whom so much had been required. She wanted to see how her mother indulged her vibrant creative spirit, she says, and where that spirit pops out. It is only in adulthood when Walker finds her mother studio. She writes, the artist that was and is my mother showed itself to me only after many years. This is what I finally noticed. My mother adorned with flowers, whatever shabby house we were forced to live in, and not just your typical straggly country strands of zinnia, either. No, she planted ambitious gardens and still does with over 50 different varieties of plants that bloom profusely. When did her mother find the time, I wonder? Walker continues, before she left home for the fields, she watered her flowers, chopped up the grass, and laid out new beds. When she returned from the fields, she might divide clumps of bulbs, dig a cold pit, uproot and replant roses, or prune branches from her taller bushes or trees, until night came and it was too dark to see. Walker describes her mother's tending with such microscopic detail that the garden becomes a world unto itself, damp and unwieldy and curious to her mother's hands. Walker writes, whatever she planted grew as if by magic, and her fame as a grower of flowers spread over three counties. The daughter remembers the people coming to enjoy what her mother had made. She says, I remember people coming to my mother's yard to be given cuttings from her flowers. I hear again the praise showered on her because whatever rocky soil she landed on, she turned into a garden. A garden so brilliant with colors, so original in its design, so magnificent with life and creativity that to this day people drive by our house in Georgia, perfect strangers and imperfect strangers, and ask to stand or walk among my mother's art. Even with all of this external validation of her gardening craft, Alice Walker notices that it is only when her mother is working in the garden that she is radiant. She says she's radiant almost to the point of being invisible, except as creator. I pause here in my reading. Walker says it's only in the garden when her mother appears radiant like this, which kind of makes me sad. It makes me wish her mother could look and feel just as radiant elsewhere in her life, in her home with her family. Maybe she did, but Walker couldn't see that multiplicity as a child. Creative solitude is what excites the writer Alice Walker that we know. The solitude is what excites her the most, reminds her of what she herself has inherited and orchestrated her life around. I hear Walker's black feminist thinking echo in Hobbs scenes, which begin in the home and arrive in the studio, another kind of garden. Hobbs gives us a third option beyond the duality of sacrificial motherhood and solitary artistry. She makes art that can't be held without holding all of her and her people too. Art that bears an integrated black woman self, supported, safe, and seen. How thrilling it must be for the children, Aidean Theo, to know that the same hands that pull them up onto the bed, turn their heads back to the home school lesson, bring dinner to the table and hold the book at bedtime, made these carvings right here, taking up all this space in places, miles, and miles from home. Those same hands here, and scene one, reaching up towards morning light. Hobbs holds a moment of inner respite in her face. Her eyes are closed. She must hear her son cozy into her partner's arms as he wakes up. I wonder how long the kids have been awake, judging the right time to descend on their parents. Her child climbs over her legs, headed for her lap while she stretches. He balances over her calves, making sure not to crush her upturned feet or loosely bent knees. That's a nart in itself, learning how to collapse onto your mother in the morning. I remember the choreography well when I linger in this scene. Anybody who has children can relate to this work, Hobbs says, in the video from the studio. In anybody who was a child, which is everybody, she laughs, you can relate to this work. The practices that go into Hobbs' home making draw on the same imaginative and attentive capacities as the labor of the studio, painting, mixing, carving. The art is in making something that lives, and how privileged are we to have Latoya Hobbs woodcuts, or prints of the woodcuts, living here for a while. Working with Alice Walker has helped me to characterize my awe when I saw them for the first time. We can't walk away with cuttings like neighbors in Alice Walker's mother's garden, but Hobbs gives us something I can inhabit, burrowing into its earth, lingering in its grooves, and carving out space for myself here too. Thank you. Thank you so much, Javana. Our second speaker today is Kayla Jackson. He's a doctoral candidate at Harvard in the Department of the History of Art and Architecture. Looking at the intersection of art history, visual culture, and black studies, Kayla's dissertation focuses on ruptural aesthetics, collage, constructed photography, and quilting, as modes of remaking narratives around black girls and black girlhood. Her writing has been published in Boston Art Review, the Panorama Journal of American Art, as well as various exhibition catalogs. In addition to research and writing, Kayla co-organized the 2021 conference titled Art Museums and the Legacies of the Dutch Slave Trade, Curating Histories, Invisioning Futures, which will be published as an edited volume through Brill next year, or actually this year, twenty-two. Yeah. Kayla received her undergraduate degree from Spellman College in Atlanta, Georgia. During her studies, she held positions at the High Museum of Art and at the Spellman Museum of Fine Art. Currently, Kayla is a Tera Foundation, pre-doctoral fellow in American art at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art and National Portrait Gallery. Kayla also contributed, has contributed extensively to museum work since her arrival in the doctoral program here, just as Giovanna did as a graduate intern here at the museum, while she was a student. Please join me in welcoming Kayla to the podium. If you listen closely, you can hear my heart beating just like Giovanna. Thank you so much Elizabeth for this generous invitation. I want to thank Giovanna because you are a friend of my mind. We've been through this together for a long time. But most importantly, I want to thank Latoya for giving us this wonderful offering, such original, vulnerable vision of your life that you shared that mirrors many of our own. And with that, I will begin. Here the sought of the earth, but if the earth have lost its savor, where will shall it be salted? It is thenforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trotted under the foot of man, Matthew 5 and 13. The question that I think we're left with is what preserves those who preserve? Year the sought of the earth. Black women are the keepers of culture, family, and history, and memory. But if the sought lost its savor, where will shall it be salted? It is thenforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trotted under the foot of man. There is merely a designation as custodian, keeper, and protector, but a notable absence of how she, in my words, is to sustain such a position only the repercussion of the failure to savor. It is the space between designation and potential displacement within which Latoya Hobbes considers the means and methods by which black women can maintain cultural identities. It is in this absence that she crafts a vision of what it means to keep and be kept through beauty. Hobbes, through her deathly and dexterously rendered 15-panel narrative arc, meditates upon what Christina Sharp considers beauty as method. Sharp asks, what might beauty open, rupture, make possible and impossible? Hobbes' response, carving time, makes legible beauty as a concept and a method. Thus beauty as method functions as a principle gesture of making possible a breaking open of space that trains our eyes and attention. Making beauty is the interior act of attentiveness carried through in every careful articulation of Hobbes' gouge. Sharp opens up beauty as a means by which we determine possibility. Hobbes inserts her work as one of the many possibilities yielded through. As an apparatus, beauty is our willingness to bring forth our visions, our hopes, and our desires. The monumental five-part ensemble is a feast for the eyes. As she brings us into relief, the narrative of her life as a mother, as a wife, as a professional educator. Hobbes' focus on home evidences a specific type of preservation orchestrated within the domestic space. Hobbes envelops us in a massively rendered ode to the spectacle of the quotidian. Undergirding carving time is a question or rather amplification of the aesthetic negotiations of form and concept. Hobbes' lines dance before our eyes, coalescing into sumptuous forms, figures and patterns that construct her various scenes. Similar care struggles the moments where lines dissolve to swallow us in absence. She offers up the home space as a place in which beauty abounds. As method, beauty is about a transfiguration of the given to borrow the words of Sidea Hartman. This metamorphous happens before our eyes, as Hobbes' carve space in time in such a rigorous manner, that the world literally opens up before us. The conjure beauty is a labor that gives back. It is a labor that is sustaining. Hobbes' endeavor to make beauty in such a grand scale relies on the notion that making and taking space is crucial to black feminist art historical practices. So we enter at the height of her narrative arc, gathering around the kitchen table, the nexus of actions and exchanges, the table invites us to the scene, yet while the interlocking and largely disavowing gazes of the actors present us with a distance. In this moment, we're engaging past and present the restructuring of the scene as a meta-picture, citing artistic and aesthetic inheritances, while also gesturing to what might lie beyond the frame. Valerie Maynard's Sennufo rhymes perfectly with Hobbes still at mid-stripe as she bounces dinner on the way to the table. The horizontal striations of the stereograph intersect with the vertical counterparts on the wall. In her appropriation of Maynard's work, Hobbes asserts an aesthetic inheritance both in Maynard and in West African figureation and mark-making, a connection reiterated through her use of a dink resembles. The work of the interior, as she shows, black feminist interiority, is to establish links to the past, the present, and the future. She cements herself within an artistic lineage of Maynard, her under her auspice and in step with her vision. To the left of Maynard, Hobbes includes Carriageing's Marshall's club-club-club place just above the family dinner table. Her referencing of Marshall evins as a tangle between concept and form, folding past and to present the entangled pair allude to a younger Jackson Hobbes. In this manner, of the dimly lit club and cocktails, is now their Baltimore home where the kitchen table is the heart. In this manner, Hobbes is crafting a narrative that extends beyond the 24 hours of a given day. The narrative portrait collapses the world's in places to construct a larger arc of her life, her family, her love. The connection between the couple now extends through the bodies of their children as the backdrop of the work, Hobbes articulates Marshall's work as the aesthetic foundation, but also their love as the foundation of their family life. After dinner, Hobbes transitions us to the children's room. Deep within the pictorial plane, Hobbes wedges herself in a moment with her son. The work of her husband, sons, and basquiat's, has dispenser form a constellation above their heads. Here again, the walls not only open up into a world beyond the gallery space, but evins and opening up the world for the children. The interior is a space through which we imagine and build worlds beyond what we can see is brought to the fore in this moment. Nearly misbened the scattered toys, Hobbes inserts the details of the San Cosa bird, a gesture to work as reaching back and looking forward. Further the melding of the world's cultures and languages within the domestic space complicates renderings of black family and interiority. Finally we reach Hobbes studio. She's perched atop a stool, confidently looking back at us, dawning a smock and discarding the beloved fuzzy slippers. There's a character shift in this moment. She balances a palette and a brush with the gouges and a woodblock close to her feet. The proximity of materials, evidence, her complex practice as she moves between forms and methods. Here she is establishing her own prowess as an artist. Aside from her posture akin to that of Marshall's own black woman artist, the scene holds only references to Hobbes work and practice. The multitude of canvases that rest against the wall create her sheer prolific talent, but also foreground her commitment to beauty as she envisions black women. Referencing an earlier work, birth of a mother, Hobbes finds ways to bring forth her capacity as a mother and artist, even in the studio space. Seed in an across-legged position, dawning a robe that bears her expectant belly, Hobbes meditates on motherhood and childbirth is equally a birth of the self. Hobbes schematically recreates her acrylic and collage wood panel of niece's Erin and Anaya just over her shoulder. In the earlier version, Hobbes patterns that girls dresses in an indink resemble resembling an afro pic. Hobbes represents beauty and femininity. The pair entangled much like the flora that backgrounds them conjures a sense of intimacy and closeness. The day ends with making. It ends with labor that is required to make beauty exist in the space that it ruptures. Hobbes addresses us in a manner that implicates us as her subjects, leaving us to consider what her making of beauty might open. How might we exist in the space of possibility or even impossibility that she creates? Thank you, Kayla. I'd like to take a moment and have a round of applause for these amazing scholars who have given up to all of them. And thanks to them for carving out time from their dissertation and their book projects and their publications for this work and for this event. Thank you. And now it's my joy to introduce the final speaker today, the artist who brought us carving out time and who is one of the most generous collaborators I've ever had the privilege to work with. Latoya M. Hobbes. She's an artist, wife and mother of two. And Latoya received her BA in painting from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and an MFA in printmaking from Purdue University. To quote from her exquisite website, Latoya's work deals with figurative imagery that addresses the ideas of beauty, cultural identity and womanhood as they relate to women of the African diaspora. Her paintings and prints are housed in numerous private and public collections including the Harvard Art Museums now. And her work has been featured in many exhibitions worldwide. At the Baltimore Museum of Art, the State University of California at Stanislaus, the National Art Gallery of Namibia and many other places. There's currently a major monographic exhibition of her work on view at the Frist Art Museum in Nashville titled Carving and New Tradition, The Art of Latoya M. Hobbes. And stay tuned. Another monographic show of her work will debut later this year at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Latoya has one several competitive art prizes and acclaimed residencies in her career thus far. She's a founding member of the Black Women of Print Collective and also a professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Without further ado, please join me in welcoming the artist to the podium. Oh, my God. Ah, first, I just want to say that my heart is just full. I'm just really honored to let me pull it together, sorry. I'm just really honored to be here. Thank you to Elizabeth, to all of the staff at Harvard for making this purchase possible and also just being so gracious to me and my family during our time here. I don't want to comment on the speakers because if I do, I'm going to, the tears will start flowing. So again, what thank you all of you for being here today. As you know, I'm Latoya Hobbes. You've heard about the various roles that I play in my normal and everyday life. For my portion of this talk, I wanted to take a moment just to give you a more holistic view of me as an artist. The work on display really shows myself as a printmaker, but I specifically define myself as a painter and a printmaker. I'm very much interested in combining those two worlds together in a way that is symbiotic. So they kind of lean on each other and inform each other and you'll see that kind of run throughout the images that I'm going to show. So the first image that I'm going to present to you today is titled, Ark of Safety, Mother and Child. So it alludes to some of the major themes that I've been thinking about over the past few years. Really this idea of what it means to be a major arc. And kind of telling the story of my journey into motherhood, which I purposely, as I mentioned to some of the donors today, I purposely kind of would held that part of myself for various reasons. But now I feel like it's a time where I am able to just fully express all parts of myself and that includes being a mother. It's like one of the primary roles that I have right now, as such an all-encompassing part of my life right now. So quite naturally, it seeps into the work. This also gives me an opportunity to kind of talk about some of my influences within printmaking. So this is really similar to a work by Elizabeth Caled, who I call one of my art mothers. And so this reference in particular was taken in the 20, Missy, this is Theo. Excuse me, this is Aide. He's about one. So this is like 2015, I believe. So we are caught in a moment of rest after nursing probably by my husband who is an artist and also a photographer. So I'm really fortunate that he's able to capture all these really wonderful images that I can then use as source material. So this photo was taken in 2015, but the work wasn't actually completed until last year. So it kind of gives you this full circle moment and this work is also significant because it is in scene five. So the woodblock that's on progress and the floor, this is that work at the time. So it kind of gives you this full circle moment and also gives you kind of an example of the traditional work that I do as a printmaker. This next work also is significant because it is featured in carving out time, but I purposely wanted to include this piece for a couple of reasons. I think it's one of my favorite works right now. I'm just one of my personal favorite pieces, but it also really gives you insight to what I mean about taking both my identity as a painter and a printmaker and putting them on the same surface. The part of myself as a printmaker that I really enjoy is the carving. So I'm taking that particular element and putting it kind of in the forefront of my work and kind of breaking the norm of what we tend to expect from a printmaker. Normally with your matrix is something that is not considered art, right? It's always in service of the addition that is going to be pulled from it. But I just find it so much beauty in the block itself. So I really started to explore this canvas, this idea of the matrix as the art object. It's something that has value. It's not only just a production tool, but it is an art object in and of itself. So in this piece here, again, you see the carving, which is throughout the figure. So these marks that you see are literally me kind of carving away from the surface of this wood panel. And then I'm kind of incorporating other things as well. So you see the leaves that are painted and carved. The flowers which are hydrangeas are carved. There's collage and the figure's clothing. There's some hand painting on top. So I really enjoy this idea of taking these very different processes and putting them together on the same surface to kind of, I want to say, bamboozle the viewer. But I really want you to spend some time with the work to figure out. And that's something that I particularly enjoy. Not only as an artist, but also as an art observer and lover. I really enjoy just thinking about the processes of artists and sitting in front of their work and trying to decide like, what do they do first? What do they do second? That's just something that I also really enjoy. I would say from a more, I don't want to say philosophical standpoint. The act of carving away from me represents this idea of carving away to reveal the true essence of a person. I can talk about like just kind of my identity as a black woman. A lot of my earlier work was dealing with the idea of confronting stereotypes, particularly through how we perceive beauty among black women. So I find that we often have to shed these layers of expectations or assumptions that are put on us to kind of reveal the true version of ourselves. So when I'm approaching the wood blocks, I think of it in that way. Almost like a sculptor, you hear some sculptors talk about like they see the sculpture in the granite before, so it's like they're revealing or letting loose the sculpture. So I kind of think about that in terms of the image formation with my mixed media pieces. So that brings me to this next work. So as I mentioned before, I do describe myself as a painter and printmaker. So this work in particular, I would say that it leans a little bit toward my identity as a painter. And there's lots of different processes that are happening. This work is titled Queen Anne. It's collage and acrylic and carving on wood panel. A couple of things that are significant about this work. This is a portrait of my mother. Her name is Angela. We affectionately call her Anne, so she's a queen. So we can go inside of the queen Anne. And without my recent pieces, I've mentioned that I've been thinking about my identity as a mother, but that also lends me to bring into conversation the idea of a matriarch. Like who can be a matriarch? Is it only relegated to women who have birthed children? But I like to extend beyond that, but thinking about people who are caretakers or people who have birthed ideas or birthed communities. It kind of extended this idea of what can be a matriarch and how I'm now functioning as a matriarch. So I've been thinking a lot about my cousins who I grew up with, spending like my summers in my grandma's house. We are running around now. Now we're all mothers and we all have children. So thinking about this idea of legacy. And it's causing me to really think about the matriarchs in my family who have come before me. So this represents not only my biological matriarch, but also my art mothers. So if you look in the background of this piece, there's a reference to two of my art mothers. As I mentioned, Elizabeth Callett is highly important. Was very instrumental into the development of my practice, not only as a premaker, but as an artist in general. So the work feature there, the kind of dark face there is titled Black Girl. And then behind my mother's head is a drawing by Simele Louis, who is also another amazing black woman premaker and scholar who is really responsible for kind of shaping and developing the black art canon. And this is like the second instance where I am purposefully referencing other artists' work through my work. So this is kind of really significant in that regard. But just in terms of like the technical aspect of the work, you can see the wood grain and what I'm interpreting as the floor. You can see the striations in my mom's shirt and the pants. Those literally me carving away from the surface and then painting back into it. There's me of a more of a traditional presence of me as a painter in the hands and in the face and in the hair. And then there's collage. So again, this really kind of mixed match of all these very different processes coming together. This next image is titled Sunday Morning. It's one of my most recent works that I've finished at the tail end of 2023. So in thinking about my current solo exhibition that I have at the Frist Art Museum where the panels from Carving Out Time are on display, I was really thinking about what was not present in Carving Out Time. So what's missing? And one of the first things that I thought about is me one being able to rest. There's no moment in that work where I'm not serving somebody else or in the mode of creation or making or doing. So this represents that for me, just a moment of rest to be able to just kind of stop and enjoy things. So this again, you see like the presence of our dining room table that happens a lot. You see it in Carving Out Time. You see it in the queen and piece that I just showed. It also shows up in this scene, again, this painting here. Things have kind of gotten a facelift like the chairs are a different pattern. So again, just kind of thinking about this idea of how we make space and the things that are important to us. And this work also, again, leans itself a little bit more toward my identity as a painter, but there's still presence of printmaking there. It may be hard to see from this image, but if you're ever able to see this work in person, you can see that the bathrobe is carved, right? So just really thinking about texture and how to simulate that. So I really just treated that portion of the painting like I did a woodcut, right? So I carved, I painted one layer to get like the brighter color and then rolled it up just like I would a wood block to kind of get this darker color. Even like the pattern on the wallpaper, that's carved. The fuzzy slippers are carved again and painted. So this is really back and forth of really the problem solving of what method is best suited to interpret this particular texture or this particular part of the room. So those things just kind of like really excite me in the work. And then the last image that I'm going to show is my most recent work. I'm again still thinking about, in carving out time, what was missing from the day. And so I'm just kind of showing our activity outside of the home. This work is titled Pinnacle. And it really documents kind of a nice family moment for us. We enjoy hiking and being outside, like around my studio, there's this really lovely park where we kind of go hiking. So anywhere where we go or when we visit home, we try to find somewhere to do a hike. So this particular location is where at the top of Pinnacle Mountain State Park. So this is the, and that's kind of like a tradition, like if you're from Litter Rock, you've probably climbed Pinnacle Mountain at some point or have heard people talking about going to climb Pinnacle Mountain. And so this was the first time that we did it as a family with the boys. And so they were such troopers and made it to the top of the mountain. We were going to try to like, there's two ways as an easy way in a hard way. And so we decided, oh, we have the boys, we'll do the easy way, but we accidentally took a wrong turn and it ended up doing the hard way by accident. But they, you know, they still made it to the top. So it was kind of like us recording this triumph for us as a family and also for them. There at the top of the mountain, you see my husband is kind of sandwiched between our two sons creating this kind of triangle shape that mimics the kind of triangle shape of the mountain behind us. But it really also for me is an honoring of my husband as well as him kind of being the Pinnacle of our family and also for me as well. And in terms of like going back to this idea of process and technique, this is kind of, I would say what I want to continue to do so you can kind of show a detail here. So you can see like a close up view. So it's still on the wood panel. I'm still activating it in the same way that I would do a wood cut. But the thing that is different, like I'm more invested in color, I went through a long spell while I was just really focused on like monochromatic and black and white and kind of having these limited color palettes. But I'm really interested in kind of bringing in more color and more flowers and foliage into my work. And that for me kind of symbolizes like the journey of myself as an artist. I feel like a lot of the seeds that I planted in the hard work that I put in like four or five years ago, all those things are starting to bloom and come to life. So you kind of see that happening in the work with a lot of my recent works as always flowers or foliage or something of that nature present to kind of represent this phase in my life. But I'm still activating them as like a wood cut, but at the same time it also kind of function as an etching, right? So kind of getting into some nerdy like premaking lingo here. But to achieve the color, I, well first I carved all the panels like I would just normally activating a wood block, which you can see like the tone of the flesh of the models in here. This is just the color of the wood. And in certain areas, depending on what color I wanted somebody sure to be, I would literally like push media into those lines the same way that you would do like an etching plate, right? So with relief, it's printed on the top of the block with etching, you push ink into the lines or into the crevices that you carve away to create the image. So I'm simultaneously working between these two ideas of thinking about wood cut, but also thinking about etching and then thinking about painting. So kind of again, like flowing between all these different media and processes. And so here's another detail where you can kind of get a sense. Yeah, of all the processes and things that are happening within the work. And so this is kind of, yeah, the vein that I'm in right now. So I love my traditional printmaking, but I'm also just really into my mix of media work and kind of creating the challenge of again, bringing all these very different processes together and just kind of a mesh of my identity as a painter and as a printmaker. So I think moving forward, you will continue to see more works that are in this vein. Still kind of the core of all the things that I've been doing already, but present to them in new and kind of still complex ways. Yeah, I think that's all I have for you guys. I'm not sure what's next. Okay, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. We'll take questions from the audience in a few moments, but I'll talk about, share first, explore first. Before we sort of, well, thank you to all of you again. So it's just absolutely marvelous. You get, you each give us just so many different pathways into, into the work and this was just a really special, special moment. Before I post some questions to the first two speakers, I wanted to give Latoya a chance to share with the audience. So stepping back for a second and talking about the two parts of carving out time, so the set of wood blocks, which are on view right now at the first, but owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art and then the prints that came from those wood blocks and how those two parts are distinctive in terms of technique, but also conceptually for you. Yeah, so as we mentioned that work exists in two parts. So for the onset of that work, as I mentioned, I'm really interested in the print matrix as the art object. So really just putting the carving and the wood panels on display. So that was the initial goal for this work when I was given the opportunity to develop them for the exhibition that they debuted in at the Baltimore Museum of Art. But through the encouragement of my husband, we decided that it would be really important for them to be printed just because there's never been, at least to our knowledge there is a like a wood cart done on that scale with this, at least with this thing. So we just kind of wanted to lean into like the monumentality of the project, but also kind of the historic nature of that as well. So from a technical standpoint, they kind of really posed some things that I had to think through. So one of the, if you just know about pre-making, whatever you print is going to be in ribbons, right? So if you think about like your hands, so this is the wood block, this is the paper, you print it, you have a mirror image, the same way your hands function. So I had to really make some, I'm going to say tough decisions, but I had to decide like for me what was going to be the primary work and what was going to be the secondary work. So I just kind of decided to stick with my thing of the blocks being the primary work. So just from a conceptual standpoint, the block is always used as the tool that's going to produce something else. It's always in surface of something else. And so as the person carving the work, you're always having to like look at the work backwards. A lot of print makers reverse their image so that when it prints, it prints like the correct way. So I didn't really want to rob myself of the experience of enjoying the imagery and the way that I wanted to enjoy the imagery. So I just kept with the idea of the panels being the primary work. And it kind of alludes to this idea of like the interior versus the exterior. So for me, the wood panels represent like the view of myself, the interior. How I see myself, how we see our family. And as in like the reverse image can also represent like the exterior view or how you can be perceived by other people. And in a lot of instance, thinking about just the experience of acting American people in this country, a lot of times there's stereotypes that is completely opposite of what are true nature or what are true identity it is. So from a conceptual standpoint, I can make it work just by thinking about like the reverses like the interior or what other people could perceive like looking on the outside. Whereas the panels are like the primary view or the primary voices of the work. Thank you. One thing that struck me in your presentation today was this week you've talked a lot about being interested in the matrix as an art object. And I think hearing you speak today, it's as though you're interested in the matrix as the art object at rest, not as a generative object anymore, right? Not producing the print. So being rolled up and that's the art. That's the generative act, which is really quite a very provocative. I had a question for you, Giovanna. I was wondering if you could say a little bit and thank you, the words of Alice Walker as you were reading it was just it was really powerful to think about the work through that lens, just so rich. I was wondering if you say a little bit more about the sensorial, which seemed to be a point of a meeting point between Alice Walker and Hobbes' work. I like your saying that her art not being able to be held, but that it fills overwhelms the visual field, right? It's more than your eyes can take in at once, right? All those details. And then the thematic of the garden and overwhelming sensorial experience of the plants and so forth. Let's see. I didn't expect Alice Walker to speak as much as she did today. That wasn't the intention until I was reading back over the piece. Originally, I was just going to reference Alice Walker. It felt like such a connection that was right there. So I'm like, OK, yeah, we can build off Walker and we can keep it moving. But when I read the way Walker is moving towards not seeing her mother's creative labor and I feel like she was able to see that from the space of childhood. And then when she's able to find a year's later at the garden and then at the description of the garden, that is so particular and so lush and so dense. When I read that, I was kind of like, oh, yeah, that's that. And so I think that in terms of sensation, I wanted to figure out, I didn't want to figure out the works as much as I just wanted to enjoy the overwhelm of it. I guess the awe of it, especially because we're not in the house with you all. So these works are always going to have a different resonance for those who actually know you intimately and personally and have been in your home and are you and your sons in your husband. And so I think that that's beautiful to protect as well. So that in some ways, I end that my comments with, you know, I'm able to make myself more at home in a way, but also that I am at home in the feeling of beholding what's going on here and that is allowing me to feel more and feel more in detailed ways and in big ways. And that I can bring with me. I'm never being in your house. So if I'm in Baltimore, we'll be out of each house. But look, I can be in your house. But I can take that with me and it is helping me change the ways I think about the interiors that I know well and like the specific attention I paid to them and just just relishing in that, I guess. So it's the detail of it and the audacity of that much detail and the audacity of the exercise that I wanted to try to articulate. Yeah, I was very much excited when you started talking about the garden and the flower reference because those are like motifs that I've been purposely including in some of my more recent works over 2023 and kind of at the end of 2022. And also like flowers are a form of self-care. For me, like I always have like fresh flowers at home, but it doesn't have to be like a special thing, but it's just kind of just small moment of beauty that I'm able to give to myself. And really, just leaning into this idea of self-care, but from a more kind of realistic perspective. I think a lot of times we think self-care has to be these grand gestures. Like I'm going to spend a week at the spa or do a staycation somewhere, but those aren't always really realistic, especially for working women. Sometimes you don't have the weekend to just go away from your family. But I can like put this bouquet of flowers that I can pass at the table and just take a glance and like observe how beautiful they are. Or for me, it's also a scented candle. It's like my space can smell good. That's like a ritual for me to do. So it's like in a studio, I pull out your hand, I like my candle and then like it's time to get to work. So it was really insightful to really hear you bring up the idea about the lushness of the garden, which is something that I really love. I love being outside and connecting with nature. I don't have a great thumb at all. So I only tell the time I thumbs a great one. I'm painting what I really do in during that aspect. So just thinking about the experience of like self-care and the metaphor of looking at these pieces as like there is a lush as the garden. That was really great. I'm going to go ahead and do that. Well, I just grew a quick, I want to add to it. I got chills when I saw the flowers on the dining table in Queen Anne. You say you don't have a green thumb, but the way that you rendered, and I don't know if those were acrylic, if they were painted or if they were car. I don't know how it works. It should still be being queen Anne. It was a combination of collage and then in the one after that Sunday morning, there was all painted. So there is where your green thumb happens because they were just rendered so beautifully and just so realistic but still very kind of fanciful. In a way, I loved it. Kayla, I loved what you gave to us with your structure. Beauty as a method, beauty as a concept that was just so incredible. And part of what was so exciting about your presentation was that you didn't just talk about visual beauty. You said the lines dance, the lines dissolve, the absence. There's, and then you took us through past, present and future melding and different physical iterations of beauty, then just purely the visual. And I was just wondering if there was anything else you wanted to add about this idea of other worlds, not necessarily spiritual, of the incorporation, opening up of other worlds. Well, when I was thinking about beauty, I'm also thinking about sort of the value of it. And I think that's something that you're getting at in your earlier works and it kind of continues through your process of how you're visualizing black women and black womanhood. And so when I'm thinking about the other worlds that you're creating, the lusciousness, I can't get over that. And that home is a type of world building. So even just that little tidbit that you just gave us about putting the lotion on your hands and the scented candles, like I'm thinking about the world that you're creating in which you can create. Like, I don't think we should take for granted the sort of the scene that you have to set in order to get to where you need to get to make the work that we're enjoying. And so even though you're describing your home and you're presenting your family life, I think the idea of the worlds that you're creating on the canvas and what you're showing us and how you're transforming even the gallery space. When I think about the many times I've gone to a museum, I have never seen a black family's world in that scale and that size with that level of care and detail ever. And so I think there's something very magical about the world that you're creating for us to live in and for us to enjoy. Not even just a spiritual and very material. You know? It's beautiful. Yeah, it's just like your conversations about beauty because that was really like the focus of my thesis work while I was at Purdue, but particularly thinking about it, do the lens of black women in their beauty practices, whether they're informed by this idea of like internalized racism, right? So do we do the things we do because we really enjoy them or because we've been taught that this is the way you present yourself. This is the way to be acceptable. This is the way to be beautiful, but really just kind of questioning, causing people not to say that one is right or more right than the other. We're really getting people to question like, well, why do you do the things that you have? Have you ever questioned that or are you just on autopilot based on what people told you? And then the work really was to serve the purpose of presenting a different option of what can be beautiful. And I was doing that just through our hair, texture, and the environment. I think about the women, like I've treated them like we're at the salon, like when I'm doing my paintings or when I'm dressing them, I also pay a lot of attention to like people's adornment, like what earrings they were wearing. Even if I like change something that's original from not to the original reference, there's a lot of care and attention that is placed on that and just a side of the earth, like what, how can we interpret beauty? But also at the point of not like trying to prove it, but just to invite it. Yes. So that was something that I struggled with a lot of my research. It almost felt like I was trying to prove that we're worthy of all these things. And then it just got to a point where it's like, I mean, I can't prove anything to you, but I can just embody it. I can just be it. And then you have to take it as however you take it. Yeah. Yeah. We're ready for some questions from the audience. Yes, Diana, do we have a microphone? I'm sorry, I just can't help. Yeah, just raise your hand if you've got a question and the person with people with microphones will come. Hi. Really beautiful show. I'm also a print maker and a painter. So I really like appreciate the combination between both the print making aspect and painting and also the use of the matrix as the main work of art. When I was looking at your paintings in the exhibition yesterday, it made me think of Carrie May Weems. And I don't know if you were looking at her photography as well. And then you mentioned the dining room table and the presence of that throughout your work. So I was wondering, yeah, if you could maybe speak more to that. And also as a print maker, I'm just interested in your line work and the decisions that you made with the self portrait, with the palette. I guess this is just more of a comment, but I love the way that you reproduce your own works and that the angle of the lines goes into perspective the way that they, you know, anyway, so that's a lot. Well, thank you for your question and your comments. Like ironically, I have been starting to think a little bit more about like Carrie May Weems because I am noticing like the tables start to come back over and over and again. And it could just be the result of like sometimes I don't have a model, so I use myself as the work to kind of convey things. But yeah, so I need to notice like the corner of the table is showing up in a lot of works and it is kind of making me think about Carrie May Weems and her table series. So that I think there's something I may start to read up on a little bit more. And then just in terms of like the line work you mentioned, a lot of the decisions really just come from just basic drawing skills, like things that you would see, like at least I teach my students in like, you know, foundation drawing, like line, texture, shape, form, value, but trying to translate that through the medium or through the element of line is like really important. So just for me, that kind of represents like the problem solving of the medium. And I think we all have our own versions of that, depending on whatever type of medium that you're working with. So it is really as a matter of like becoming like having the sense of like intimacy with the subject, like really taking time to look at it and investigate it. And I think about often like if somebody from my audience was holding this thing, like how would that feel and trying to replicate that feeling through the mark making? Yeah. Thank you. Oh, first of all, I just want to say that your work is visually stunning, engaging, and it's quite remarkable. And I think most of us who get the opportunity to see this are quite moved by your work. I also have some questions about the technical way you approach your work that shows a very different image of you. Is that because you've changed or is that because when you approach the subject, you see more of a mirror image of yourself? A lot of the thing, like the reversal of things, is again, just, you know, you have to chop it up to the nature of printmaking itself. And so there's always this like idea of like thinking about it in reverse. It's one of the reasons why I don't use text a lot in my work because you know, when you're planning out your image, you have to draw it backwards and reverse when you're drawing it. And then, you know, so it can print in the right way. So I just, I don't know. I kind of avoid it. And also, just in my normal work, like even just like my smaller pieces, I don't take the like extra step to reverse the image beforehand. It's really not that important to me. And also it kind of gives me like a little bit of a surprise, right? Because you're seeing it in a different way, because I've spent so much time with the block and seeing it in one orientation, the print work is almost like a still a surprise, even though I know what the imagery is going to be. I think that was a question. Is it my turn? Yes. First of all, I just, I've been following your work for years. I'm such a huge fan to me or would cut goddess. I'm a, I'm a would cut artist myself and figurative and it just, it blows my mind. And I have, you know, kind of nerdy would cut question for you, which is basically how, how detailed is your drawing on the block and how much are you figuring it out as you're going? Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, it's very detailed. Like I spend a lot of time on the drawings. Like the drawings could be the finished product if I wanted to just show the drawings. And I feel like because the work is so detailed and there's a lot going on, I really take a lot of time to investigate the drawing itself so that it creates just a clearer pathway when I get to the carving process. So as you know, like once it's gone, it's gone, right? So, you know, when in doubt, don't cut it out. So when I always tell people, you're starting, what cut? So yeah, there's a lot of time that happened. So just in terms of like process, I recently, I've say over the past maybe four years, I've started the process of just painting my panel's black first before I go into the carving. So the traditional way is that you have your wood surface. Some people like sand it and like shellac it. You may draw with a sharpie and then some people stain it with the red, like, you know, a red dye or something like that. That was just too confusing for me with the red because I started to kind of think about myself as a painter because there was like three values present, right? There's the wood, there's the black of the sharpie and then there's this red. So it kind of just created like too much. And so I tried it that way and I was like, I don't understand why people do that. But I said, well, it just makes sense if it's going to be a black and white print anyway. Why don't you just start with a black surface and you do your drawings of the white pencil because it's closest to what the end product is going to be. So with these panels in particular, they're cherry wood panels. All of the panels are eight feet tall, four feet wide. Three of them come together to make the scene. When my husband was helping me set up the studio, we put all three panels on the wall at one time. So they're already painted black by the time they go up on the wall. And then from there, just the really detailed drawing with this white water soluble pencil takes place. And you know, some things like I just kind of make notes like on the and the dinner scene, for example, like I'd have to draw like the squares white because that's just kind of unnecessary label, but I did write white on the square. I just do a little bit of exact or something like that. But definitely on the figures, like the details on the clothes, anything that was like small in detail, like the artwork, those things were like really, really drawing in. But it was just something like I didn't take time to like draw everything apart of the chair. I just kind of made notes and did like shading because you know, that's taking away from my time to get into the carving. But yeah, to answer your question, like the drawing is like very extensively done before I get into the carving process. Thank you. Can I ask one more little question? So are you working sometimes upright and sometimes you're down on the floor? For the large pieces, they're always upright. Always upright. Yeah. So in like the video in the gallery and also on the video on my YouTube page, you see sometimes I'm working on the floor, but that was at the point where like all the carving had already done. And so I was kind of like maybe just touching up some things, like on the floor or something like that. But for the initial like ground drawing and carving, they're always up on the wall because there's just gives me the ability to step back. From it, which students step away from your work while you're working. Just so you can see everything and you're also able to like know to share mistakes better when you step away from it. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, Miss Hobb. My question for you is how did you arrive at the um concept of bringing your family into your work? I know like in the black community, our family's very private. But I really appreciate it because it makes me appreciate my mother as well and all of the things and all of the hats. My mother wore when I was much younger. So how did you arrive at the idea to showcase this? Because not a lot of black mothers receive their flowers. Yeah. So for me, it's just really because it's my life. And I think earlier in the gallery today, somebody brought up the idea of like vulnerability. And I think for me, that is really the power of the work because it does give you the opportunity to again, to think about your own situation like your own parents or your experience as a child. So for me, we just like like really natural. So I am showing you the intimacy, but it's also like not everything. Right? Because you know, some rooms just really aren't that clean. Like right now, like I will be, you know, there may or may not be laundry baskets. Like besides couch waiting to be folded when I get back home. So it's still like an opt-in to look, but also there's still some things that were still like preserving from holding back at the same time. But yeah, I think the vulnerability of it and the realness of it is again, where the power and the strength lies. But then there's also coupled with the care that I am putting into just the development of the imagery and like the details. So there's yeah, just a lot of like care. So I like to describe this work as a labor of love, really like love for my medium. I also love for the people that I'm representing. Like I feel like it's an honor to do a portrait of someone. And for me, it's like my duty or it's like my job to really present them. Like in the way, you know, that I see them. It's like, I don't know, it's almost a disservice if I don't, I don't know, portray you in this kind of like really detailed, really specific way. It's a scene, by the way. There's a question here in the middle of the aisle. Thank you so much. Thank you for presenting your work. I really am just taking it all in. And I wanted to ask you about maybe the obvious things, which is just the huge scale. I mean, how you did you go from a, I mean like a obviously smaller, what was this the first time that you worked on? Such a large scale and maybe talk about what that that transition was from a smaller to a large scale in your prints? Yeah. So I, one, I just enjoy working large scale. Like this just really excites me. Like even in undergrad, I was the student like, toting the big like canvas across campus, but some of my painting classes. So yeah, I just really enjoy the scale of the work. This working particular is inspired by a set of suite of prints by Carid James Marshall. So at the time, I first experienced that work in 2014. And in my own practice, I had just finished graduate school at Purdue University. And my, well, we would then just good friends then. But now we're husband and wife. We were on a trip in New Orleans and we saw the 40 Americans exhibit when it was traveling for the Rupus collection. So at that time, the large of what could I had done was eight feet by four feet. It was a large figure of a woman like holding this cloth, partially nude on this like eight by four feet, um, um, blocked. And so seeing the Carid James Marshall work like I just know even like no concept of a woodcut being done that large and in color. So yeah, that was really like instrumental in me in terms of like bringing this work to fruition for the scale, um, in particular. Was there a second part to your question? I'm sorry, I just kind of saw it at random. Yeah, I, you know, I also really love clay. Like in, in like undergrad, that was like one of my other like favorite classes to take. Cause like the ceramics class and like my sculpture class. I decided not to do that because I didn't like the fact that I needed a kiln to do my work. And so I'm very much into like, I don't know, I just like being able to do things on my own and put making was like, I guess the best medium like you didn't, it's good to have a principle. If you don't have a pressure to still do printmaking and I don't need other people around to be able to do it. So that was kind of one of my dissertations of not like really leaning into sculpture. But when I'm forming these images and like drawing and carving, sometimes I'm thinking about if I'm holding, if I'm shaping this with clay, like what direction will my hand be moving the clay? So then that becomes like the direction that I make the line because I find I have an arm as a cylindrical shape. So the lines should move like a cylinder if I'm going down the side of the face. If I would mold the clay down like this. So that's the same direction that I make the lines go. So really playing with this idea of like contour and cross contour. And then I guess going back to the scale. When I was making this work, I kind of felt like, I was still like a really like largely unknown artist. But at the same time, I felt like I had the skill. I just felt like I wasn't as far along in my career as I wanted to be or maybe I wasn't as widely known as I wanted to be. And so when I was invited to do this show at the Boston Museum of Art, I really thought like this is like, I don't know, there's just some moments where you have these like opportunities that are life changing. And I saw this as one. I was like, this is the time like if you wherever you were going to show out, like you need to show out in this show. And so I actually came up with the idea for that work before I was offered the exhibition. But telling her about that work, the curator who invited me to be a part of the exhibition, and kind of like sealed the deal for her and made it really excited to give me support to get that work done. And yeah, I saw just like this is an opportunity like you really need to take advantage of this. And I often kind of think about Carrie James Marshall, some of his lectures. He talks about like you have to know how to play the game. And if you want to be a museum level artist, you have to show works that would necessitate being in a museum. So yeah, and I think this work like feels that like some people can get noticed with the whisper, but some of us have to shout to get noticed. And so I just really saw this is like a really, really important opportunity. Because I was already starting to get some traction, like I'm just down to some like really significant residences. I just want like a major enterprise in my city. So I felt like the momentum was starting to go, but like this was like a really, really good opportunity to get more eyes on your work, to get more visibility. I'm going to secure something that people have not seen before, but still doing it in a way that you're not compromising yourself, you're not doing something that's just a fan. That's very big for me. Like I don't do stuff just, but that's popular. I do things that I'm passionate about and really playing on my skills, like what am I good at? And what can I do that you don't always see? Right? Because there's a lot of like artists making figure to work a lot of black artists and like portraiture, but what am I contributing to the conversation that people don't see often? And you know, and shows you don't always see you like they're making right? They're carving. And so like I carved really well, like I, you know, I'm kind of humble. So I can always like say things like that. I know that I can carve. And so like let me just put that thing to the forefront because that's something that not a lot of people can do on that same type of level. Could that's a quick clarification? With the clay, you say you think about how you might mold the clay and then you do people do that? Is that a thing? Or did you organically start doing that? I don't know if it's a thing with other people. It's kind of, you know, I just think about like other things and how they relate to what I'm doing. That's brilliant. And it really is because something that I was thinking about when you were showing the pieces both in Queen Anne and then also what is it? The Erin, Erin and Erin and I and I and Hydrangeas. So I was paying attention even with the work of you holding your son. And the work of you in the morning, there's this, when you do serenity in a face, you do it so well. And it doesn't look like you're trying to depict peace, depict serenity. And there's something like about about the skin and about the way that it moves that just feels so organic and I'm trying to make sense of how is that related to wood or paper? How is she doing this? And so then when you talk about how you think about molding, how would you do this with clay? And then making the mark in that direction, I'm like, oh, there it is. And so there's just something about that hybridity that is is revving me up. I think that's so brilliant. And I think it also lends it to like how I think about drawing, how I think about painting. I don't separate how I think about that. So, you know, some people when they're getting ready to do a block, they may like, okay, I'm drawing this way because I'm doing a block or I'm drawing this way because I'm about to do a painting. I don't, the foundation of the work is the drawing. I don't think about them differently because I'm about to do one thing or the other. So, I'm very much like, I seen tones and value shifts really well, which I think is a key component to people who do like portraiture really well. If you think about painters, they're able to notice these like really small subtle changes in like the curve of a lip or change like of a shadow or a light. So, that's how I process the imagery. It's like through these value changes, shifts. Whereas somebody like my husband, he's really good with like line, cross-hatching and things. So, I have to take that sensibility of how I just naturally see images and how I naturally think about the imagery coming together, but just trying to translate that through like the lines. I'm really into the call of the lines like blending, yeah, old it into each other. So, just kind of like this, and drawing we call it continuous tonality. So, I'm thinking about the continuous tone, but through linear tonality, that makes it. So, in Queen Anne, when you did your mother's face, did you also mean to kind of mimic, I don't know, if I'm using the right term, the values are the tones that Catlett does in the piece behind her? Because I actually see they're very different, but I was noticing I'm like, wait, I see something, there's something that's parallel here. Which is like the spirit drawing. Yeah, sometimes you don't notice things in the work until after you do them, but for me it's very, I'm just kind of like an intuitive process. It was even like looking at carving our time and talking about it to people, like I was saying things and I was like, oh, I didn't even really notice that about it when I was making the images, but now like it all kind of makes sense. Like in the boys' room, I didn't even make the connection, like there's a Boschia dinosaur picture, but then there's a dinosaur on the floor. I didn't even make that connection until to see in the work again, like I didn't even really think about that. So sometimes it's like intuitive decisions and then we have to look back and look at them, like oh, yeah. There's all these kind of connections and through lines and I like the fact that other people have said that every time they look at the work they see something different in the work. So I really enjoy that aspect as well. I have a question over here. Thank you so much for the work and I really appreciate all the sort of symbolism that you put into these different pieces. And I was just noticing now that you sort of have a halo around yourself in the last image and the sort of triptick nature of your pieces. It's really reminding me of sort of like religious iconography and the grandiose scale of it. And you're sort of now putting the black home in sort of a state of being worshiped. And I'm just sort of wondering how are you choosing the different the objects or people or relationships or things to sort of venerate in the modern age? Like how are you choosing that? Well, in this particular, going back to your comment about the halo, there was a period of time where the halos were a constant motif in my work and that just kind of a result of my experience as an artistry student of an undergrad, lots of people, like halos everywhere. So they just kind of naturally seeped into my work. And so often all I kind of bring them back into the space or into the work. But in terms of like just really thinking about how to construct these environments that I'm presenting to you, you just really think about like what types of things do you have attachment to? One, then secondly, like can I actually carve those things? Like how would they work like texturally? I also had to think about the color of things. Like because I knew it's going to be like not color, but just value. So you have to think about like the color of things. So I purposely like in all of the things I have on a white shirt that's you know, in purposeful like to make me stand out in the scene. I always have these black pants on. So there's like also like value choices or color choices that you just have to think about in terms of like the image formation of like being an artist and thinking about composition, right? There's the theme and all the things that you have to put in it. But it's also like the literal part of how do I make the work? So a lot of those things are like very, very intentional. But some of the things were just like my favorite hoodie at the time or the how shoes that my son had just gotten for Christmas, the dragon how shoes or their favorite toys. And also just at the same time like what would look good aesthetically? Like putting all these things together. And also for me just the personal challenge of having to try having as many different types of surface textures quality just to kind of like you know, challenges of like can you carve these fuzzy how shoes and make them look fuzzy? They're believable like can you make this granite countertop look like it's granite? So just you know just a personal challenge of like pushing yourself right? Because that's where the growth happens and where the problem solving happens. So I would say like you know I had already done a lot with my carving but this just gave me like so many opportunities to learn and grow and challenge myself and push myself even more. Hi, Ms. Hobbs. I just want to say that you're really an inspiration for yeah no it's okay. Would you like me to stand? I see you now. Okay I just want to say that you're an inspiration for me as a young artist who's also a print maker. I wanted to ask have you ever considered doing reduction on this large scale? No. That is something that I have like wanted to get back into and actually I was at a six-week pre-making residency over the summer at Women's Studio Workshop and so that was one of the things that I wanted to do but I like ran out of time I was like as you can tell I'm overly ambitious and so I had like all these projects I was had like 15 things and it's been a while since I've just been purely in the mode of print making so I forgot about oh I have to tear paper and oh if I do multiple colors I have to let this dry before I can move on to the next thing so I just kind of reminded of some things in print making that I hadn't had to do in a while but I did have on my list to do a reduction could not this big but just to kind of get back into some older processes that I do it happened in a while I also love monotype that's another thing that I do in terms of print making and a couple weeks ago we do on a little for the first time since undergrad since undergrad so you get to see like a little bit more of like the drawing aspect of myself but through the medium of print so it is on my list to get back to but not this big that would be something interesting to explore though. Okay last question have you considered printing on different type of mediums like cardboard or fabric? Yeah I have done that so in undergrad but in graduate school I went through a phase of like printing on fabrics so when Walmart still had their fabric section I would just kind of go and raid the scraps so I have a lot of prints on muslin I have a lot of things on like like post-weight I have and it's like things that people haven't seen but yeah I've kind of done all of those things and some of that was out of just one the curiosity of how I can do these different surfaces but also at the same time like I went through this phase where I was again thinking about melding the painting and print making so I was treating cam treating my prints but then stretching them like you would stretch the canvas so I went through like a little bit of phase of that so yeah I don't do that as much now just I'm really into like the wood panel but yeah I've experienced it with different surfaces as well. Stay up time for one more question. I just wanted to have a comment and a question so the comment is just to thank you so much wonderful to see as a black woman in the art world to see the three of you up there so just thank you and I hope to see more of this as we continue on representing ourselves in the art world also just to miss Hobbes thank you for presenting the black woman in a rustful way in some of your paintings or your your prints you know here she's stretching you know it's it's often when I see art sometimes of us as black women I see pain in the pictures and so you're giving me joy in your pictures you're giving me power especially the one in the right bottom of this frame it's just it makes me feel great to look at your work so thank you for that and I guess my question is the last piece that you showed with a lot of color in it and had the blue the blue sky and I was wondering how you did that because there didn't seem to be you know any carvings in that or if that was just painted or how did you do that yeah so that was well thank you so much for your comments and yeah I think that's a goal of mine like we'll multifaceted people so we can experience the whole gamut of emotions but with the piece that you're talking about is spinnical so again that is like really me kind of flowing in between like painting and printmaking and so when I'm thinking about an image I really have to think about like the order of operations so something that I like to do is like if there's going to be like carving and painting and collage I try to have some evidence of that early in the process so I'm always comparing things to each other because like you know with the carving I don't want to wait I don't want to do the carving first and then I put like the bright blue and then the carving doesn't look how I intended it for look because I'm comparing it with this intense color so after I did the initial drawing with the with the white pen so the blue was one of the first things that happened on the page so my husband he has experienced like with mural work so he helped me like mix the blue I told him like this is what I need he went and found the colors help me mix the blue masked off the figures and then we just did like a roll with like a roller a big like paint roller to get all that blue down first and then pull that up and then now I have like this intense blue that I'm comparing everything else to in the work and then same thing else like after I did the blue then I just put in like the green of the trees even though I knew there was more work that I had to do but I just wanted some like evidence of every major element that's going to be in the work so I'm always bringing up all the image together and nothing is like an afterthought and everything seems harmonious and relates to each other everything feels like it belongs in the space together because I'm bringing everything up at the same time but yeah that is just paint but but the clouds are a combination of like painting and carving together yeah thank you so much thank you let's try it thank you",

It's a portrait of a woman from three angles. What I'm doing right now is removing two layers of varnish on the figures because the varnish has discolored with time. And the discoloration created a much darker white tone that's almost warmer in a way than the background. The varnish, when it first went on, would have given the figure an added layer of sheen and saturated and deepened the skin in hair tones. So we're really fortunate that the head of the painting's lab, Kate Smith, interviewed Hendrix shortly before he passed away. And then he was able to tell us a lot about how the painting was made, how it had changed over time, and his feelings about both of those things. So he thought the discoloration was the oil paint that he used to paint the figures, but through sampling and materials analysis, we were able to find that it was actually the varnish layer that had discolored. So we were able to remove that without affecting the paint underneath. By removing that varnish layer, we're able to see that relationship between the two whites that he originally intended. In the interview, Hendrix made clear that this circular impact crack distracted from the image. So following the varnish removal, I'm going to focus on reducing the appearance of that crack. Having this art go out in a state where it can be enjoyed the way it was supposed to be is what gives meaning to my work. My name is Ellen Davis, and I'm the associate painting's conservator here at the Strasse Center at the Harvard Art Museums.",
13,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:INV203453_dynmc?width=3000&height=3000,Stacked Color Drawing X,Richard Tuttle,1971,"So good evening or should I say good afternoon, it's kind of that in between moments in our day, I'm Martha Tadeski, the Elizabeth and John Moore's Cabot director of the Harvard Art Museums and I'm delighted to welcome you this afternoon to an early summer revel in the many splintered art of watercolor. As is our practice, we begin our program with a land acknowledgement. Harvard University is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusetts. The original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge, we pay respect to the people of the Massachusetts tribe, past and present, and honor the land itself, which remains sacred to the Massachusetts people. So today we are celebrating the museum's new summer exhibition, American Watercolors 1880 to 1990 into the light. And I'm sure you, many of you understand the kind of double entendre of into the light, right? It's such a light filled medium, but these are also works that are often very much protected and hidden away in storage rooms because they are vulnerable to light. So we are bringing these treasures into the light this summer and looking for to the conversation we will have with all of you. The exhibition will be on view in our special exhibitions gallery on the third floor through August 13th. So make the most of it while you can. Watercolors have this fleeting thing, right, where they can't be on the wall for too long. And so we have to pay a lot of attention to them when they are on the walls. The Harvard Art Museum's holdings of American Watercolors from the late 19th to the late 20th century showcase the artistic freedom, the medium of fords, as well as the demands it places on its practitioners. Built over a period of more than 100 years with the purpose of studying and supporting contemporary artistic practice, the watercolour collection at Harvard embodies the museum's continuous engagement with the art of the present. We are especially delighted this afternoon to welcome artist Richard Tuttle who contributed to the catalog and whose artwork is on view as part of the exhibition. Richard very shortly will share a reading with us and will also join in conversation with members of the dynamic watercolour curatorial team, including, and I'm going to let you know who they are right now. Yoakim Homan, who is the Mehta and George Abrams curator of drawings, Margaret Meg, Morgan Graselli visiting senior scholar for drawings, Miriam Stewart, curator for the collection, Alisa Hermann, Lunder Curator of Works on Paper and Whistler Studies at the Colby College Museum of Art. I'm stumbling over this a little bit because she was with us only weeks ago as the Emily Rao Pulitzer Curatorial Fellow in contemporary drawings at the Harvard Art Museums, but she's now at Colby and her new colleagues are here to support her, which I'm so pleased about. And then finally, Penley Knight, who is our Philip and Lynn Strauss senior conservator of Works on Paper and Head of the Paper Lab in our Strauss Center for Conservation and Technical Studies. And I should mention that our conservator colleagues and Strauss are increasingly part of our curatorial teams for every project that we do. So exhibitions at the Harvard Art Museums are realized with the help of generous donors and I'm pleased to acknowledge them here. Support for this exhibition is provided by the Alexander S. Robert L. and Bruce A. Biel exhibition fund, the William A. Murray fund, the Rab family exhibition funds, and an anonymous donor. The catalog was made possible by the Andrew W. Mellon publication fund and the Wyeth Foundation for American Art. Related programming is supported, and this means lectures and study days and so on. Related programming is supported by the M. Victor Leventritt lecture series Endowment fund, which was established through the generosity of the Wyeth children and friends of the late M. Victor Leventritt class of 1935. The purpose of this fund, which we rely on for many, many of our programs, is to present outstanding scholars of the history and theory of art to the Harvard and greater Boston communities. In the current exhibition, we are showing watercolors by artists as far ranging as Wensla Homer and Salawitt, Edward Hopper and Beaufort Delaney, Helen Franketh Aller and Romero Bearden, Alexander Calder and Hannah Wilkie. As heterogeneous as this group might seem, the artists are united by their respect of the medium, each embraced watercolor for its specific qualities, as opposed to imitating the effects of other media, such as oil painting. Even while successive generations expanded the definition of what a watercolor can be, and I hope that will start a really wonderful summer long conversation here at the Harvard Art Museums. To end on a personal note, because I've spent a long time as a curator of works on paper, thinking about watercolor, and have often thought about how I feel about watercolor as leading me back to when I was a child. I hope this exhibition will help you reconnect with the joy you may have experienced as a child, playing with a brush and a small box of watercolors. Do you recall the first beautiful strokes of pure color on a white page? Yes? How about the thrill as the edges of the pigment diffused into pools of water creating something you didn't expect? Yes? Yes. If you are like me, maybe lacking a little in restraint, you might also remember when your exuberance eventually yielded a disappointing brown mud puddle. The result of mixing every color in the box. Yes? Yeah. Okay. That got the most hands of everyone. So as this exhibition and its handsome catalog makes clear, the lessons of this art form and the emotions of evokes risk-taking and restraint, playfulness and mastery, delight, and despair are ageless. It is now my great pleasure to welcome to the podium. My colleague, Joachim Homan, Mehta and George Abrams curator of drawings, Joachim led the curatorial team that you're clear from tonight and will moderate the discussion. First, however, introduce our keynote speaker for the afternoon. Thank you. Good afternoon. I'm Joachim Homan and it's such a pleasure to finally celebrate together after years of preparation. It's wonderful to see you here this afternoon and to think about the watercolors, look at watercolors together. Our exhibition is in the third floor. Some of us have not seen it yet. We just opened and we invite you after the lecture to explore it more in full. Our program today is not designed to give you a comprehensive introduction to the show, which is far too complex in order to give you a sense down here. Taking a stroll through the galleries will be much more fun for you, but we want to share with you a few of the aspects of our work with watercolors that kept engaging us, kept motivating us to dig deeper and to learn more about the medium. Martha Tideski as a watercolors specialist and colleague curator in the past has challenged us to come up with a show that's different and special and that goes a little bit beyond what traditional watercolors shows are like. That's what we did and when we presented our exhibition concept to Martha, she said, this is a different show in a good way. So, Martha, we are really delighted to do this work with you together and I hope that you recognize your leadership in the exhibition concept. There was such a joy to work with you on this and I also want to think at this point, Richard Tuttle, the artist who's visiting us today from New York, who has been a partner in conversations about watercolors, about works on paper, about the meaning of art over many years and has really engaged with us as an essayist for the catalog and the contributor to the exhibition in our evaluation, how watercolors and why watercolors are so important and resides at the core of American art. So we will try to address some of these issues today. As Martha mentioned, the show is unusually broad in its chronological development from the 1880s to the late 20th century. Of course, we were all excited about showing you the masterpieces by Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent, John LaFarge and the great masters that endeared the medium to all of us. And I saw the hoppers here for the first time. I thought, these need to be on the wall as quickly as possible. Let's do a show. But I realized too that there are many artists over the decades who engaged with the medium who came to it from different angles, different backgrounds, some of them with academic training, others just as amateurs and you're seeing many of those included in the show as well. Another color is a medium that allows us to tell a richer and more complex story of American art. And we are very proud to present you a cross section through a collection that is very dynamic and that has grown in the process of the preparation of this exhibition. The museum acquired several important works that are on view for the first time through gifts, through bequests and through purchases that really transform the way we can access this medium. When you hear this afternoon, first from Richard Tuddel from an artist's perspective about water color, then from a panley knife, the head of the conservation center for paper and curatorial colleagues with different kinds of backgrounds, you will understand that water color is an open medium, a medium of inquiry, a medium of possibilities and that the nature of change and exploration that this show wants to make visible is very much at the center of what water color is about. As an artist's story, I shouldn't talk too much about it because Richard Tuddel as an artist has first-hand experience with exploring that. And I would like to say a few words about Richard Tuddel to those of us who are not yet familiar with him. Richard, of course, has been an active contributor to American art already since the late 1960s, which sounds strange because his work today is as current as has ever been. It's inspirational to a lot of artists across the country and around the world. He's currently exhibiting all over the place, just concluded a very successful show this summer. Excuse me, this spring at Pays Gallery, the gallery that represents him and can't wait to get into his studio in Maine tomorrow to start working on the next project. I think Richard, with you, it is more about the future of art making than about the past and that's something I really appreciate. And I hope that we cast some of this forward thrust that you bring to the conversation about art into this exhibition that we are seeing upstairs. Richard is a graduate of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and studied briefly at Cooper Union. Transformative for him was his work with Betty Parsons, a gallery that represented many of the great abstract expressionist artists in the mid-20th century. And it was there that Richard became familiar and became a friend of Agnes Martin, the great artist who's represented with one watercolor upstairs as well. And his practice, of course, far exceeds watercolor. You will see that Richard has a lot to contribute about watercolor, but I don't want anybody to get away with the sense that Richard is a watercolorist and that's the end of the story. It would be a little bit misleading. So I have to correct that impression right now and just hint at the fact that Richard is known for his installations, for his drawings, for prints, for artist books, also increasingly for his poetry and he's going to read a poet in a moment. He presented his first survey exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art as early as 1975 and has exhibited internationally ever since, including a traveling retrospective organized by the San Francisco Museum of Art, a commission installation for the turbine hall at Tate Modern. Not too long ago, Solo shows at the Metropolitan Museum, the Phillips, the Pulitzer, in Zurich, Tokyo Beijing. You name it. It's a place that splits his time between New York, I would cue in New Mexico and Mount Desert Island in Maine and is the author and the artist behind many books here on campus. So his work is represented in our collection at Harvard, not only in the drawing collection and print collection, see at the museum, but also which we represented in the Fine Arts Library where you can request as many of his artist books for review. Richard, thank you so much for joining us today. The floor is yours. Thank you. You're so much to do. Thank you Martha and thank you walking. Poem for watercolor. There are four groups of my watercolors at the Harvard Art Museums. The studies for cloth works, 1967, the stacked color works, 1971, the notebook drawings, 1980, the incandescent light drawings, 1990. This list circumscribes a lot of attention in the medium without having anything definitive to say. How can we have focus with no focus? Is it a kind of fairy tale where a princess wakes up as a frog, metamorphosis, a most new world form of art or theater where true identity is only revealed in the last act? Better? Watercolor just misses secularization and remains holy in its most humble voice. Studies for cloth works, 1967, used paper like a dye used cloth, dying sufficient fibers to change line into color, color into complex being. Leached out like a flying crane's legs behind, not a space on a paper, but paper in space. Too much dye for New York. The crane will land, legs confer the grip as the event feels feeling. Here there's not one single person, linen makes wider. We've behaved watercolor with so many tracks. I thought if it worked, if it dented, what if it dented? Stay in the bed and be quiet, it said. Then a stacked color work on its side and see if it comes up. There could be lost a profundity in an hour by pain, ride or a uniform dried out and weeks without rain or hose. As if the horses came forward without entrals or even to meet. To turn out, the canary said the video will meet the sky. Want to say something? A piece is a block and a pineapple in largest. This great people say, watching the xylophone knock the singer and worry about the band leader. I thought I lost a culture, thought the winner. It doesn't meet the first time. I'll be happy with our child because the child doesn't want the same thing as the canary. Doesn't want the canary at all. Notebook drawings are paintings, whole and full. They didn't know about it. That's what I figured it came from. I was going to stay until it all worked out and it was a discovery until the due date made it there. It's an absolute truth. It's going to get pain in the can. Need a little French? Need a little Ken? What bites? Blue lines like a cough concentrated on little bits. Hicks with holes numbed with satisfaction. Seen above horses, backs, parallel, light like planets. Or did we loss of average? Loss of language. Synergies, blue of the moment. Let's picture a frame. Every moment of waiting, our tale can be seen, proceed. I got out of the cab for you once. The flip is part of a two part, listen, aid. And two, subtly and phone number. When green makes the wall green. The actual enveloped love, self-conscious, no escape. Pretorian to the last in a tiny room, this all happened. Water color has become. Oh no, how did that happen? Not about becoming. Another telling us what is American in watercolor? O'Keefe, Marin, Demos, Dove, Fininger. There should be a show of just stiglitz's stable of artists, watercolors. Don't we not want to be American? They drew with watercolor for a line. Their watercolor absorbed into the paper before it became line. Line is the basis of drawing. How does one stabilize before the line disappears? It's easy. Line is the source of structure. Make structure the source of line. Up to you. I love that. I love the color. Hello everyone. It was hard to pick what to speak about tonight. I'm going to touch on two things. The first is the materials case. It's not very strong collection of artists. It's full of all kinds of materials related to watercolors. A particular highlight is this new acquisition of a deluxe wooden watercolor box from Windsor in 1863 to 1881. As most of you know, the British company, Windsor in Newton, is one of the most recognizable names of proprietors of high quality art materials. Very, very popular brand. Inside this beautiful watercolor box are various watercolors supplies including 18 pristine dry watercolor cakes. You see there in the front. Two ceramic pallets, a watercolor brush, and there certainly would have been more of those. That seems to be one of the few things that's missing from this case. A wooden brush holder, a crystal water bowl, and two sponges. Narayan Kandakar, a director of conservation recently bought this box from Mark Mantin Art in London specifically for the exhibition. We are so grateful to Meg Morgan-Roselli for making this acquisition possible. This is a brand new thing for us. In the same case, there's lots of other things, but be sure not to miss John Singer Sargent's watercolor tubes and some of his brushes, which have been known to actually make people cry because they're so excited to see them. Especially watercolorists themselves. The second moment I want to touch on is about reserve. So reserve is the blank paper that's left where there's no watercolor, there's no drawing. It's intentionally left blank by the artist, and this needs to be planned out ahead of time. There are so many great moments of reserve in this exhibition, but I'll focus on two. Charles Birchfield took the unusual approach to the interaction between watercolor, graphite, and paper in August sunlight from 1916. Most of the plants are drawn in pencil, but the actual watercolor only surrounds the pencil. It surrounds the negative space, is leaving these funky, foliate silhouettes. This is most apparent in the foreground plants. The roofs are also completely devoid of color, creating a geometrical interruption against the leafy abundance. Birchfield doesn't even bother to draw the top of the roof. He just lets it end and lets the green behind frame it for you visually. The impact of Birchfield's remarkable watercolor and his negative spaces is somewhat dulled by the overall browning and fading of this watercolor due to some overexposure to light. So you can even imagine how much more brilliant this would have been when it was freshly made. But still, we just love these funky shapes, especially in the front. In the second one on the right, by Richard Foster Yard, this is a brand new acquisition from 2021, Yard likewise leaves parts of the composition blank. There are strong reserves at the top of the window, and in the woman at left and the person at right. But much of the reserve appears at the edges, and it bleeds into the prominent yet crooked borders. The entire configuration has a geometric presence. The discrete areas of color and pattern recall to my eye would block prints in their rectangular forms, especially in the background yellow. The borders and the reserves are all part of the jigsaw puzzle here. The areas left blank are both unexpected and I think quite brilliant in this powerful watercolor from 1980. And so those are two moments that particularly intrigued me and now of Tamirium. I think it's great to see all of you and to actually be here with watercolors in person after starting this project during the pandemic. So we were working at home on Zoom. So it's really a pleasure to be here. And I want to say, John Singer Sargent once remarked about watercolor that working in watercolor was making the best of an emergency. And I think we all understand that, though all of us who worked in watercolor as Martha referred to earlier, because when you're working with watercolor, you have the sort of stubborn quality of water, which is, you know, is unruly and it goes its own way. And so the control over the water or the lack of control, whichever you're looking for, is something that's essential in watercolor. And you'll see all different examples of that upstairs. When an artist addresses their sheet of paper, whether it's tacked down or taped down, there's a relationship to the body, whether it's, you know, if it's vertical, the watercolor is going to run down. If it's horizontal, you'll be able to keep it maybe more stable, but maybe it will pile more. So thinking about all these things, I want to talk about what we call our hero image, the John Marin beautiful watercolor from 1914, which is we think maybe executed just right outside of his door in Maine. He started going to Maine in 1914, this great spitt of land and casco bay. Marin really inserts himself into this watercolor. Again, thinking about the body and the sort of bodily engagement. It's like he's diving into the water, diving into the watercolor here. If you look closely, you'll see that the tree is composed of his fingerprints. Did you catch that? So if you're looking and making it so literally just, you know, leaving his imprint in the drawing. And then you can see the pink strokes at the bottom where there's kind of a heavy stroke at the top. That's the watercolor being on a fingerprint and just swiping down. So literally this kind of insertion of the artist that, you know, direct and indirectly into the watercolor. And at the left, and I hope you can see it here on the screen, the sort of smudging of the water of the ocean. And then he drew with maybe the, you know, a sharpened end of a brush or some kind of a scraper or sharp tool. He drew those kind of, you know, childlike wave lines to indicate the water there. And you can see that. And also the mist that's rising from the ocean or just the spray. He's blotted that with using something like a rag to kind of just remove the watercolor. So watercolors can really, it's surprising how strong they are because you use a really strong paper much of the time. It's amazing how much the surface can be beat up. If you look at a watercolor by Sargent, and these are both, of course, up in the exhibition. Sargent's also using a lot of, a lot of interventions into the watercolor here. So if you see in the trees, he's scraping, oops, let me just go back here. There we go. If you look in the trees, he's scraping away up at the upper right where you can see the removal of the watercolor. So he's using a sharp tool again to kind of make those furrows that's raising up the edges of the watercolor. And then in the pink flowers, you can see kind of a scribbly notion. The scribbling is from using a candle maybe or a transparent crayon and using a resist. So think about that too from when you were a kid. If you draw with a crayon and then you go with watercolor, it beads up and leaves that kind of staccato texture to give this fantastic array of sort of sparkling flowers. And just going back to the body one more time, Sargent picked up the watercolor when it was damp and you see his fingerprints at either edge. Something to just think about and pay attention to upstairs. On to the next. Coming to Harvard three years ago in March 2020, the week after everything closed down. I never expected to work on a show like this. I went to one of my first curatorial meetings and you often happily announced that this had been accepted as a future show and said would anybody like to work on this show with me? Absolutely. My area of expertise is old master drawings, anything before 1900 from the European schools. So embarking on this was a total adventure for me. And an adventure of love because of course I'd been introduced as an undergraduate here to artists, the wonderful collections of Winslow Homer and Sargent. But this exhibition of the goal was to go far far far beyond that. And for me discovering so many more recent productions, gorgeous watercolors was just such an energizing and livening exciting adventure through this whole thing. And it was hard for me for this particular presentation to choose one work to talk about. But this one captured my fansky in a way that no other work did. I mean, yes, the 16-foot saw the width that closed the exhibition in the last gallery is pretty amazing in many ways. Call of the works by any number of different artists, Rothko, I mean just so many wonderful things. But this by work by Bill Trailer stood out to me as just completely exciting and different and grossing work that I really wanted to spend time with. I knew nothing about him and for those of you who have never heard of Bill Trailer or know very little about him, he was actually born into slavery. In 1853 or 1854. And basically had a hard-scrabble existence. He was a tenant farmer. He ended up on the streets of Montgomery, Alabama, homeless after working all sorts of odd jobs. And he picked up a pencil literally at the age of 84, 85, 86 in his mid-80s. And that's when he started making drawings, picking up pieces of scrap paper, poster board, cardboard that he found on the streets. And just with the simplest of media, a brush and gouache, watercolors, opaque watercolor, he made remarkable images. That recall his life, his experiences. Here obviously he had been a farmer and here he is presenting a man with a plow and a mule. What is extraordinary, what we discovered actually in the process of preparing the exhibition, the work went up to conservation, was removed from its backing. And this is the scrap that he picked up that he decided to work on. It's an ad for Granger pipe tobacco. And you can look on Google and you will find these ads with sportsmen. Not much has changed, honestly. And this is a young basketball player who played in the National Basketball League in 1941-42 for the Akron Good Year. Winf-Wing-Foot, Winf-Wing-Foot, Winf-Foot. And it says here John J. O'Brien Jr. star basketball player, he played one season for this team. But it's interesting that we know what he picked up off the street or presumed presumably off the street or out of the garbage or whatever. And looking at that, if you see the upper corner is if you flip it, it's that lower right hand corner. So the choice that trailer made in shaping and deciding how to use this piece of paper is really interesting and how he used it and fit this composition onto this oddly shaped scrap is really fascinating. This is a completely untrained artist. I don't want to call him an outlier or anything like that. He's an untrained artist who had an innate intuitive sense of design and composition. The way he fits the man up in the corner into the right angle with that hat across the echoes the shape of the corner and the way the figure fits with the foot. And the hat lined up along that edge. The way the mule, the nose of the mule follows that diagonal edge of the right hand cut of the page. The way the mules feet, it's hoofs, actually curve along the curve of the page. The way the plow comes down across and you can feel that there's a distance both physically and in space between the figure of the body. The way the figure of the man with the plow and the mule and it's emphasized by the plow, the way the plow is shaped. And then you have that scrape across the back, which I literally figured out today that this was a poster that actually stood on a counter and it had a backing, a cardboard backing that held it up. And so he tore off or it was already torn off that the thing that held it up and made it stand up. And it makes this scrape across the back that he uses almost as a furrow, almost as the kind of furrow that the plow itself is going to make crossing in that space. And even the loops of the of the reins echo that curve of the bottom. This is a wondrous composition and it is fabulous to have it in the context of this exhibition with all sorts of artists who are skillful in their use of the media, are skillful in their use of compositions and to include Bill Trailer in here I think is just the best part of the show for me. So one one things about watercolor many often have visions of vibrant color applied softly on bright white paper showcasing grand landscapes or seascapes intimate portraits or luminous abstract compositions yet the watercolor that you see here is none of those things. I remember so clearly when I first saw this work in person early in my time at Harvard I called up countless watercolors to the art study center and recall being struck by the presence of the potency and potential of this work to abandon an instant what I thought I knew about this remarkable medium and the art historical tradition that defines it. A painter, illustrator, photographer and lifelong advocate for social justice, Ben Sean warned against against artistic complacency, believing artists should be compelled by life and that it's only against the background of hard reality that meaningful forms can emerge. As a social realist Sean addressed political themes in a modernist yet forthright and personal style but the material qualities of his artwork were deeply informed by a subject matter and this is so evident in the watercolor scene here. Executed on a delicate and absorbent Japanese paper that bears his inference as well Ben Sean's 1964 monochromatic watercolor confrontation is simple and contemplative. Skofully diluting washes of black and gray for artistic effect Sean conveys a deeper meaning visualizing the need to face not only our differences but also ourselves instead of an overtly hostile encounter. Sean beautifully leverages the inherent fluidity and opacity of watercolor to depict the transparency needed to achieve an open dialogue but also hints at the complex and at times uneven nature of discourse and exchange through the ambiguity of his forms. Rendering silhouetted faces and opposing moments of speech and silence, sight and blindness, corporate reality and disappearance. Look closely while upstairs in the galleries to see how the physicality of his breaststrokes freed the fragile paper fibers for a deliberately unfinished and smudge aesthetic, signaling the lack of a tidy societal solution to the persistent racial and cultural divides of 1960s America. Indeed in reading through the exhibition catalog recently I was struck by the final line of Richard Tuttle's essay where he writes quote, watercolor as an open tool relies on its power to contradict. A sentiment that resonated so deeply with me as I encountered several watercolors in the collection that at first glance seemed out of step for the American watercolor tradition as I knew it. Still it was through these moments of apparent contradiction that I was able to reimagine how we decide what classifies as a watercolor as well as begin to develop a new understanding about the myriad of American influences that led to their creation. What emerged were several artists from different backgrounds working in the mid to late 20th century who were unafraid to compromise the purity of watercolor in pursuit of meaningful and material innovation. Amid a century marked by moments of political and cultural destabilization the field of American watercolors similarly entered undefined terrain as artists relied less on professional organizations for training and resisted affiliations with art movements or techniques instead embracing individual impulses to address conceptual aesthetic or sociopolitical concerns. Recognized as one of the most creative and original visual artists of the 20th century, Romeo Beard and experimented with many different mediums and artistic styles, but it was his use of collage and watercolor that was transformative for me while working on this exhibition. Beginning in the late 1960s Beard and began one of the most artistically formative periods of his career moving beyond painting collage and printmaking via more prominent and painterly use of watercolor. A mature artist at this time Beard and was fearless and confident in his use of this fluid medium allowing it to boldly consume the photographic compositions that he assembled for great emotional and atmospheric effect. Beard and rejected popular tendencies of pure abstraction in the American art scene of the 1960s and instead employed a more thoughtful visual language that offered intimate albeit bold views of the African American experience. Often showcasing figures engaged in minimal activity in an effort to highlight a sense of community vitality and resiliency in his stunning compositions. For him African American women were critical figures in his work frequently shown as a strong and supportive presence and occupying roles that were as mutable and dynamic as his modernist collage and watercolor techniques. After 1970 the artist increasingly celebrated the central dimension of his female subjects celebrating their nude physical form and works such as the watercolor scene here entitled Madam's White Bird from 1975 which captures a candid moment between five women in various stages of undressed. Although their circumstances remain ambiguous the addition of colorful yellow, blue and red watercolor in live and the otherwise gray domestic interior. There is less vulnerability and heightened autonomy in the lone figure that you see caressing a white bird in the center who acts as a focal point as well as in the artist's placement of two fully nude figures in the immediate foreground who are uninhibited and comfortable. Beard and rendered the solemn and everyday aspects of African American life and culture into beautiful and complex visual emblems. But his inclusion in this exhibition also allowed our wonderful conservators to dig deeper into Beard and experimental use of watercolor and collage allowing us to celebrate his contributions in expanding the field of American watercolor and its creative boundaries. In this exhibition we chronicle the evolution of the medium over the course of the 19th and late 20th century. With a particular focus on technical trends and innovations and the tools and methods used to create watercolors like pigments, brushes and paper production. The accompanying catalog we're also reflecting upon the aesthetic nuance is required of an artist working in the spontaneous stimulating and challenging medium but still making important connections between the past and the present. Particularly the evolving notion of gesture and form in the development of the medium. So I hope when you're in the exhibition you get a sense of how contemporary practitioners also look to watercolors a creative challenge. Confronting hard truths via an art form that requires a similar urgency and immediacy as part of the creative process. I was so inspired and continue to be so thank you so much and I'll turn things over to Joaquin. Thank you. I think we're offering you a lot of ideas and you can tell how energizing this project was with working with many curators who look at things in different ways and getting an artist involved to questions the very nature of watercolour and makes it work in so many different ways. I want to take a moment if I may to show you a work that we have in the show upstairs that reminds me of the way Richard looks today in his costume that transforms him himself in the performance of watercolour. This is a group of works that I on view that I call it a study of a stack of color. The early works that question the nature of watercolour and especially the nature of line. It's beautiful to read in the catalog about it and to understand Richard how you were interested in developing a sense of line, a sense of drawing into an understanding of color and of the color. The line as a connector, as connectivity as something that embraces rather than separates. I think that the art that you are bringing and the wonderful poem and your performance today enhance this understanding of a watercolour as a welcoming and inclusive form of thinking about art. I am wondering whether we want to look at this work for a moment and I will settle together and we can have a few questions amongst the curators and with Richard and then open up the conversation with the audience if you have questions after these thoughtful presentations and questions that might arise from your own encounter with watercolour as an art form. With watercolour specifically in the galleries, of course, we are happy to address them as well. So many of us have understood the role that curators are playing as developing the world. We have understood the role that curators are playing as developing a looking guide for watercolours and helping to relate the work that we show to the reality of the visitors and the experience that all of us bring to it. Richard, if I can draw your attention to this beautiful work that is exhibited in the galleries, there is something of great importance missing from this picture because we, as you know, completed your work just in time for the exhibition and I was wondering whether you wanted to draw the attention of our visitors to this significant detail. I believe Joaquim is talking about something that is written on the back of this drawing which says that it is not complete unless it is framed according to this recipe that is very precisely stated. I am even surprised because I think of myself as someone who is very concerned with the profile of the frame. But this, actually, very generously says I don't care what the profile is as long as the front surface, the leading surface is silver leaf and the inside, the interior lip of that profile, the one that points inward from side to side, top to bottom, is gold leaf. And I can't express how astonished and pleased I am that the show happened and motivated the effort to make the frame as requested. And because, well, as an artist who has made their own frames, I certainly can say that no one, including professional frame makers, can any idea how much work it takes to make a frame. Indeed, a good frame is supposed to look effortless, as if it just appeared out of nowhere and so on. Like a dancer making that leap, the hours and hours of practice is supposed to be invisible when that leap takes place. So I find one of the fundamental qualities that is available through this exhibition to us is the openness to see the medium as open. And as possible at the moment. And so this work started from the very open beginning of seeing our everyday experience of the medium. And our reliance, in fact, on our incandescent light as a subject for just the way of ours of flowers or landscape or portrait or all these things can be. And I think I don't have the right to go on that much. I think I would like to try to share this idea that at the end of the second world war and appreciating that people don't go to war unless there's no other solution available. And therefore one can say what was going on here, what was so important to make war. And I think all of us, whether we're as sophisticated historians, sitting in front or not so sophisticated, can understand that the content, the content per se changed, exploded, took even a place that is hard to comprehend. But as a working, as a person trying to live a creative life, I understood that traditional content subject matter is gone over there. And what's in front here, and the issue was that each artist in the social glue, as glued together socially, has a job or role in that social glue to choose content. And if you're excited by that, then you also realize that your imagination can get behind your choice of content and you can explode. And drawing, as it's framed here, and my gratitude is, as I say, inexpressible, but it's exploring a viewer art relationship where the perpendicular relationship is, shall we say, coming from the moon indirect light, whereas the reading of the drawing, and I think that's another change that's happened almost unconsciously, that we start looking at a visual presentation of our, for example, the Romeo Bearden. And I find it's a beautiful example of how you read, how you can go laterally along that surface, and almost, you know, the freedom and the excitement. There's almost nothing that you can, you know, he pays the slightest obeisance to the perpendicular, and everything is in the lateral like that. And I think this is an artist not like myself who has always loved philosophy and maybe overthink stuff and all that, but the, like, okay, perhaps that's, if we can keep the Romeo Bearden in our minds and then look at something like this, it's the same. You know, you're just invited to run your eye laterally as you like, you know, and I think as Romeo Bearden, my humble interpretation of Romeo Bearden is the figure is made structurally to, as you move laterally, like Mozart or something where no phrase is complete, you know, it's always, you know, each, just as each phrase comes to complete, it moves someplace else like that. And you get this wonderful, wonderful, and it's what the, we mentioned Saul, Saul Lewett in this, that he can use a surface as such as the, what's happened is the, that surface, whether it's the paper of watercolor or the wall itself, has symbolically come to represent consciousness, human consciousness, you know, and when you get an artist who allows you the freedom to move through that, it's one of the most exciting visual experiences you can ever have. It's just wonderful that you are exercising for us the freedom of moving back and forth across art history, finding references and works in a way that we really envision visitors will do and enjoy making connections, and you're, you're thinking about the space that invites viewers to engage with your work and the work of other artists. You were just mentioning the paper that is becoming a metaphor, becoming a ground to think of, and I have a question for Penley, you, so many of us in the world, all of us have contributed something to the conversation that otherwise would have remained invisible. And I have to confess that, Penley, it was your work throughout the preparation of this show that made paper visible to me as a, as a focus of inquiry and thinking. If you would just say a few more words about that and help all of us who are going to explore the show throughout the summer to figure out the role of paper. I get to talk about my favorite thing paper. What I really love about this exhibition is all the works that are not on sort of traditional watercolor paper, so traditional watercolor paper is pretty stiff. It has a little tooth, so it can hold the dispersion of water and pigment in place and allow you to move the watercolor around. But what really captured my interest in Miriam and I worked on this together was all the papers that are totally not for watercolor. So the calder, for example, the two hippos where he's using bond paper, which is like office paper. It's so smooth and it freaks out when you put water on it. So it's all crumpled up and I love that. And we have a bunch of drawings in our collection by calder that are on this bond office paper. And just sort of says to me, these are things that he's just having fun with. He does use gorgeous artist paper for some of his ink drawings, but in this, these hippos are just undulating. They're great. You're using sometimes school book paper, lined paper. Susan Freacon is using gorgeous Japanese paper, which also totally overreacts to the watercolor and makes these beautiful undulations. And she also uses some Indian papers, which are old papers that she got through a friend that are all burnish so they don't totally absorb the watercolor. It sort of sits on the surface. There's just so many great moments of paper in the exhibition. There's the soluit that's on this huge machine made rolled paper that we literally like had to rassle to put on to the wall because it's got so much memory of being a piece of rolled paper that comes off. The paper making machine that way. What other ones am I not thinking of, Miriam? Oh, yeah, the Astoria, the octopus drawing that is on this fantastic blue paper. It is an artist paper, but it's not for watercolor, but it's definitely up to the task of it doesn't like get these cockles and undulations like some of them. But yeah, there's some really beautiful paper. So I'm glad that you started to really see them for themselves. Yeah, one exactly. And one of the aspects, Miriam, that you described in your conversation, you started with the sergeant quote, is the sense of urgency, the sense of emergency. And it tied together with the thing that you said in your beautiful poem that I can't wait to read again, Richard, water color has become. Oh, no, it seemed like a really beautiful and concise poem. It's a beautiful and concise description of the process of watercolor that challenges people to think on their feet, to interpret what is happening on the page and get right to it. And I want to say something about the speed of application. We have watercolors in the show that are extremely elaborate and applied with beautiful, I mean, diligence and then others that are very speedily put together. I would love to hear more from you. Right, I think we all have this kind of basic idea of watercolor from I have to say kind of going back to Homer, right, we sort of think this is a watercolor. This is what a watercolor is. And yet in the exhibition, there's a certain amount of speed and deliberate, but also deliberation with Homer, Homer was great at planning ahead. I don't think there's anybody who's, I don't know this might, I think he's just an amazing watercolors and he just really does incredible things. So we have this idea of watercolor is being speedy, but it's not necessarily that way. And as Penley talked about with reserve, you're thinking the artists are thinking ahead. Sarge is thinking ahead when he's thinking about layering what color am I going to put down pale green here, then I'm going to put some crayon down, then I'm going to put dark green over that. So the light green will show through so that kind of thinking ahead, which I'm find really difficult to really comprehend how the artists do that. Some artists are very straightforward. Somebody like Hopper seems to be really straightforward or you'll see some of the other artists in the exhibition who are very deliberate with tiny, like using tiny brush strokes, whereas others use big fat brushes. And you'll see with Sarge and Spreshes, there's a really fat one called the Sky Mop, which is just literally looks like a mop where you can just like slather on the watercolor. So it's been a really wonderful experience to try to kind of to take into account all of these kinds of styles of watercolor. Penley and I, when we started working on this exhibition, we took a watercolor class over Zoom because I was during the pandemic. That was not easy. But it was still really helpful. And thanks to our, our, our patient teacher out in Lexington who it, it was very helpful to get that sense because you do have that kind of intrinsic feeling of all of us do like the watercolor pans that we all used and what how the watercolor behaves or doesn't behave. Right. Meg, I'm fascinated by the way that you're describing the new trailer and I've told you that before, but it's just unbelievable to me how as an old master drawing specialist, you are able to look at this work and you're describing it so beautifully. The subtlety of it that many decisions the artists make. But it does it fit it how I mean how does it fit into concepts of skill, of talent, of mastery in the way that you have cultivated throughout your career. It goes back to my early hard training, close looking, appreciating the, I don't want to call it markmaking, I don't like that term, but the marks that are made on the paper by whatever media. I think I, I think I lost my day. Throughout art history, what an artist does for an artistry, what an artist does is magic and looking closely and trying to analyze without losing the sense of wonder and beauty that these artists produce with a variety of media, not just watercolor, but bringing what I had learned. I had learned a long time ago to this completely new area of study for me was not to change the way I looked at things, but to adapt to what the artists had done and see what they were doing to create these remarkable works of art. I think that skill and talent, I mean these are what we expect of an artist, don't we Richard? I mean it is what we expect, but what I find in the context of this exhibition and it's what goes back to what Miriam was just saying. And then, apparently also the variety of ways that talent can be exercised and shown and the skill, it covers a huge, huge range. And I think what anybody going into the show will discover starting with Homer and going to Saul LeWitt, through Richard Tuttle and everybody else is the huge variety of skill and of talent. It's wonderful to see that variety. Elisa, you brought to the exhibition the most serious question and I think also a demand that you put on the table to redefine what we understand as American watercolors in order to create a platform for those contemporary artists who feel they want to intervene and engage with contemporary issues with the concept of art. Issues with the contemporary world whose voices need to be heard because they have something important to say. Do you feel like after working on this for two and a half years that you got closer to that goal? Yes, I think it was really inspiring the way that we came together as a team, all with different specialties and areas of interest. And we're able to kind of look at the collection holistically and see where the gaps were, see where new additions could be made and also just find treasures among what we already had and hadn't really considered as part of a survey like this. So to see Philip Gustin in the same show as Whistler and Homer and Hopper is really compelling and exciting. And to me that was really the most enriching part of this is that we found a way forward to make these conversations work and not have it feel like it's out of step or out of place. But really, I mean the amount of time that we all spent calling these works back up to the Art Study Center, I commend all of our collections team here because the record shows that we looked at these things frequently throughout the course of this project. And that's really what you have to do. I mean that's something that Richard was also saying this morning when we were talking is that, you know, even when you were saying that you never look at the same color twice. And I thought that's it. That's exactly right. These works are so interesting and dynamic that you can't really read them the same way forever. And so that really hit home to me is that water color is a similarly kind of exciting medium because we really could find a new way in. And I hope that this exhibition kind of continues that conversation in the same way where nobody's going to look at these things the same way again. So I have a question for you. So I have a question for you. Because there are some new acquisitions that were made while we were organizing this show. And the beautiful Delaney was one and the Sam Gilliam is one. I love it if you would just talk for a minute about those acquisitions and how you feel about them. And she wants to do me a favor after this program. It do spend some time in front of the same Gilliam and and also the both for Delaney because they are both extraordinary works. And they are challenging both in their own ways. The both for Delaney that we were able to acquire just a few months ago doesn't reveal itself so quickly. So I decided not to show you a slide of it. I just asked you to look at it carefully because the colors are going to resonate with you the longer you look in different ways just in the ways that Elise I described the moment ago and Richard addressed earlier with colors that change in front of your eyes and make you think they reveal themselves they reveal a light as you are discovering layers and become more perceptive and you are suddenly realizing how they the colors the glazes are filtering a light that is of course generated by the reflection of the paper. And that all water color I mean I learned from that and I learned from our conversations that a great water color artist understands that this is not about water. It's not even necessarily about color as a substance but it is about an ability to filter the light to play with the light and to enhance the light so that work like this beautiful water color by Richard Tuttle and others in the exhibition doesn't just reside on the paper but they are becoming a part of the space through the light that they are. And they enrich our lives I think in ways that are visible upstairs but very difficult to capture in words so I won't even try but this might be a good moment if you have a few questions for us and especially for Richard they would be wonderful to share them at this point. I have a mic for you ma'am. Hi I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about your process do you I sort of imagine when I look at this I imagine you probably had a and I could be this is just me that you may have had a whole wall and maybe six pieces of paper like that lined up and I don't know I just kind of see this is maybe part of a energetic series I don't know if that was that or not but when you went ahead and started creating this piece. Was it preconceived or was it you were experimenting as you were proceeding you know making those gestural strokes and I was wondering if you could just talk about that a little bit more. Yeah I think I think the we we achieved in in in in this work you know which is what two three four years going on we've rolled we've continually rolled forward I think all of us have said that that was the experience of the show took us. And a kind of forward momentum and one of the places I I remember was I think this okay Richard what what's Richard going to do okay so. This is a you know you spend that amount of time and this is a thing and I don't mean any in any way to reduce it but but in order to make a show we have to make the content of the show. And of course there are good reasons and bad reasons and we we have to discipline ourselves to keep the good reasons and coming for us working for us and then the bad reasons going away from us. I think but the in this awareness of the thing you you have a case where the artist is going to work on on the paper on the okay not too I'm so stimulated by everybody's conversation but I think I'm going to do that. I think you know us us you know we we love to find a way to record and record as much as we can and then we love to store it away and then we love to access it when we want to later on. And of course everybody's in love with the computer at the moment and that's what you know it's enormous but any one of these works of art is so much greater than a computer because it a computer doesn't you can't record the emotional you can't record the magic of the space of an idea you know you can but. So this is and I love to think of the storage of the museum is just you know alive with these things you know which can be you know I love to go into the absolute that there was you know the artists who was motivated and and that there was a major cause. And then they achieved that ambition that was connected to that cause you know and then it's here and protected in an incredible institution that has served art for this amount of time I mean it's but you know it's it's as good as we get but at the same time I want to say I'm going to say I'm going to do that. As far as a tool and you know the job of the exhibition is to one show that it's a tool to show that that tool is available to all of us either as visitors or looking or making and then it's available in a concrete it's available to you know. So this is an as an object and and that I can't help but feel is like the hinge because in the same way the watercolor works to collect what is desired on a horizontal surface it's actually in the same way. So it's intended to be shown on a vertical surface and so this is typical Richard long way around that there's no way the process could be achieved on the wall you know that and that's maybe I can speak for a large not every artist but a large group of artists that that the there's a kind of sadness because you would want to record everything on the vertical surface but this medium doesn't allow and one of my favorite works in the show is the San Francis where he is he he painted on a rice paper and then he put that rice paper on a board a kind of Bristol board and then he put that board and and onto a canvas canvas backing and somewhere in those attachments he turned it vertically and at that moment you'll see drips the blue that he painted at that moment will have drips but we have no idea whether he did that on the rice paper we did that on the or whether he did it when it was fun and I find that I think that's something I'm going to take home and try to explore because because the mystery or the beauty of the art that I'm going to explore. The art of that piece is is physically well I actually I should I should do you have any idea when he put it vertically to make the drips. He must have done that kind of early in the process because you know it's still running but whether he did it before he mounted it I'm not sure but we could take a look at it and think about that I'm not sure that to be honest that I thought about that part like when he did it but just that he did it obviously early because it's dripping right down. Well and as a sculptor and maybe that's a part of like for example an exception I mean one one has to you know cut out one's niche or territories something like that and and for example I find you know the wall is already beautiful it's already you could say as much as consciousness could ever make it if there were an act on that wall that symbolize or defined as consciousness. So for example some part of my work I did irregular octagonals on white paper bond bond white paper and just wallpaper paste to them on the white wall and what I found when I finished that body of work that my mind said that even though the composition was trying to be thin even though the wall was not. The paste was trying to be thin even that in reality or if one critiques that in terms of whatever we have available to guide us to. So in terms of the reality there was still you could drive a truck between the surface of the paper and the surface of the wall so that's what I when I see that Sam Francis I think you know between the rice paper and the Bristol board you could drive a truck through that you know and go through that you can and and so my gosh you know when did he paint that because I'm I'm not that I have your expertise but the but I did look at the blues because and I think in a way it's artists who say you never see the same color twice and so he knew that and when he was evolving his statement. There's a synchronicity of the development of the paint and then the development of the surface that the paint and and I'm so happy to see my work next to his in the same corner because the works of mine actually follow the last part of my poem where I'm saying you know you don't have to lose line just because you use color that and but there's a little you know what my tongue and my cheek because just about that time I understood and this is through you know hard daily working that that European the tradition solves structural problems in black and white and fills in with color you know once the but but if you look at and in textiles for example you see they solve structural problems with color you know and it's color is so much more exciting in and you culture than it is in European culture so why not go in that direction you know and and that that's a part of Sam Francis and we must have been born at the same what twins well thank you so much for sharing these observations Richard I think many of us are now eager to go upstairs the exhibition is open until 630 so those of us who haven't seen it yet are invited to take a look and I just want to thank you Richard and other participants here for really wonderful talk that gave you a taste of our conversations that made this exhibition happen and that will continue throughout the summer so we invite you to be part of it and see the show today and come back and enjoy with us what we learn from it maybe it even generates a whole lot of new work that we can enjoy and collect.",
14,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:DDC252136_dynmc?width=3000&height=3000,Fragmentary portrait of a man,Unknown,Late 2nd-early 3rd century CE,"Hello everyone and all welcome. I want to begin by acknowledging that Harvard University is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusetts, the original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge. We pay respect to the people of the Massachusetts tribe, past and present, and on the other land itself, which remains sacred to the Massachusetts people. My name is Georgina Raina and I am an associate conservation scientist in the Strauss Centre for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums. This virtual conversation is the last in our series of talks exploring our Funeral Portraits, held in conjunction with the Special Exhibition Museums, Funeral Portraits from our Egypt, facing forward on view now and through the end of December. I'll just say a few words about the format of this event before I address our guest, Hadondine. This conversation is taking place in the Zoom webinar format. Hadondine I will speak for about 20 minutes before turning to the audience questions for the remainder of this time. I invite you to pop questions and comments into the Q&A box as they occur to you throughout the conversation and we'll turn to these at the end. Hadondine is an assistant objects conservator at the Art Institute of Chicago and before Chicago, she was the objects conservation follow in the Strauss Centre. Hadond shared her expertise as an essay contributor to the online digital companion to the exhibition and we're delighted that she's here to join us today. Today my conversation with Hadondine will focus on the three-dimensional portraits which is one of the three kinds of portraits that we have in our show. They're displayed alongside the painted wooden panels and of course the Funeral Shroud that was the focus of the last conversation between Caitlin and the Zep. For those of you who have not had the chance to see the show in person, we have four three-dimensional portraits on display. We have the one from the Harvard Collection and then we borrowed one from the Rhode Island School of Design and two from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. These portraits are often referred to as masks. They were made during the same time period as the portraits painted on wood during the Roman Empire Egypt. Similarly to the pattern portraits, these three-dimensional portraits we were seeing the Roman influences and the representation of the person depicted being combined with the more traditional Egyptian funerary practices. Okay so to kick us off, Hadondine, at the museum we've been studying our painted pattern portraits for some years. We've been trying to understand how they were made and the materials used and with the development of the exhibition it really became the right time for us to study our three-dimensional portrait. So I'd love to invite you to tell us a bit more about the portrait in the Harvard Collection and why the study is important. Thank you, Georgina. So while there is a large body of literature on ancient Egyptian polychromy and Egyptian portrait on wood, there is relatively limited technical research on this particular kind of funerary portrait. This object was made in Egypt during the period of the Roman Empire as Georgina said, it's a plaster head of a man and it has significant remnants of paint on it. And while this is a fragment that had itself is intact and it's stable condition, so you can see the man has facial hair who's wearing a cloak and tunic and there's translucent glass over his eyes or four his eyes. And the face portion of this at least would have been cast in a mold with details such as the hair and ears added. And face would have been further shaped to individualize the portrait. The hair and beard are dark brown and there's a red brown used for the edge of the cloak on the back of the neck. This would have originally extended farther, likely including hands crossed over the chest as shown in the drawing on the left and been placed over the head area of a mummy. On the right here is a more intact example from the Louvre. And this type of portrait is just one of several categories or kinds of portraits that were being produced during this time period at different workshops. So to show you some things that you would notice if you were looking at this object very closely in person, there are two colors of pink on the face. There's a darker pink over a lighter pink. The eyes are covered with translucent glass plates. There are painted eyelashes and eyebrows and there are remnants of dark red and nostrils in between the lips. And one of the first things that examination has resolved is that we are now fairly certain what this image on the back of the neck was. So on the left is the back of the neck of this portrait that harbor. And the backs of the neck of these portraits often have scenes of Egyptian iconography, sometimes gods, and often a mummy. And looking closely, the remnants do seem to be consistent with the head and feet of a mummy. On the right is the back of the portrait from Rhode Island School design, which is on view now with the Harvard example. And it seems very plausible that the same imagery was on the harbor portrait. Thanks, Heather. It's really interesting to think about how this portrait might have looked in comparison to what it looks like now. Much like our study of the painted panel portraits, this technical study set out to identify the materials used for the three-dimensional portrait. And hopefully to gain a better understanding of how the portrait was made, was there anything else you hope to explore this one? Yes, so in addition to the materials and what it originally looked like, we were trying to explore construction. And Nazia Muleur is a researcher in Germany whose thesis focuses on these Egyptian human fininary portraits, these three-dimensional classrooms. And she has attributed many of these portraits to different workshop groups. And these workshop groups are named for the tomes where the portraits are found. She's written about the characteristics they can be used to sign workshop groups down pro-NOTs portraits. And so this Harvard portrait was likely produced in Middle Egypt and it's been attributed to one of two groups produced by workshop that made the pieces found at Tuna Ellicible and Antonopoulos. And based on the hairstyle, she dates into the second half of the second century AD. So anything we were able to find out about the construction methods of this would really inform workshop practices now that we're able to attribute these portraits to different groupings. That's really interesting because we've been thinking a lot about the idea of workshop practice for the other fininary portraits as well. So I think we're ready to delve into the technical examination side of things. Myself and the other curators of the show have really enjoyed being able to show examples of technical imaging in the gallery because it's really helpful to look at these portraits with different illuminations. So I think here it would be nice to show an example of technical imaging to show what you found when studying this portrait. Absolutely. We have some images ultraviolet fluorescence. So here we are illuminating the portrait with UV light and then we're seeing visible fluorescence. And this allows us to see the white painting on the cloak which isn't so distinguishable in normal light as well as areas that fluorescent orange pink which is characteristic for matter lake. And you can see more of that on this side of the cloak. So we're currently identifying this pigment just based on this characteristic UV fluorescence. We don't know 100% for sure that it's matter lake but we're fairly sure. And if you look closely, you can see remnants of lines here in these areas. And here's a comparison just to show you how little you can see that pink pigment in normal light. There's really just a hint of pink. It's fairly noticeable but when you look at it in UV light you can really see the remnants of those designs. That's great. These images are such a wonderful example of why technical imaging is such an important part of a conservatist toolkit. I think it would be really easy just to just not notice that matter pigment being there but rarely is not understand how widely it was applied across the cloak. It's also interesting that it doesn't appear to have been used in the face which we've seen in some of the other painted panel portraits. So I wonder if we might switch now to look at how the portrait was constructed. You mentioned that it was one of the major questions so how much could you learn about the construction from just close looking? So we were able to learn some very close looking and then we ended up doing other techniques. So according to the literature the face was made separately and mold and methods for making the rest of the head differed possibly based on workshop methods for inserting the eyes differed and the chest and neck areas were often constructed from panels for certain types of these portraits. So and investigating how this was constructed now that we have provenance from Ozzie's research would allow us to compare our findings with work turds from the same workshop grouping. So first just looking visually you can see this stratigraphy of the underside panel on the chest panel. You can see some differences in color here and both are both these clusters are coarse and have what looks like sand mixed in. And this is the lower back edge of the neck and you can see even more layering here. So at least four layers visible. So the one on the far left is in the underside panel and then the one on the right is the back of the neck but there are some other applications of plaster in there. And here we can see what might be joins. This is the ear area and the face portion that was made in a mold maybe it ends here at the front of the ear. This could also be the edge and the ears are described as being made separately. And at the bottom we're seeing the join of the cloak panel to the head where it got been quite get filled in like it did along the rest of the seam. So these details give us insight into some of the construction methods. This is that area there. And another detail is that there are actually finger smears on the forehead and finger marks on the test in the plaster. And some references talk about these portraits being covered with a final skim coating of fine plaster. And you did later find some evidence that fine plaster does seem to been added in areas. So that tells us a little bit more as well. So that's just looking without applying any other techniques yet. And that's a lot of information I think just to get from the looking. If the head was pressed into the into a mold, would we expect the inside of the head to be hollow? I know that the portrait is sealed at the bottom so it's not possible to see inside the head. Were you able to look at it with x-ray geography? We were. So we did do x-ray geography because you're right this portrait is closed on the bottom. We can't see inside. On the right is an x-ray deocraft. So just like an x-ray of a body cart, the white parts are where there is more material for the x-rays to pass through. And you can see that the head is hollow. So we're seeing sort of the walls of the head. And at first glance, the walls and the panels, everything seems pretty even. You can see the panels of plaster used for the neck and the chest. But as you spend more time looking at it, you start to notice some irregularities. So the texture of the hair complicates things here. But you can see what look like lines. Some of them are outlined in green here. It may be seams. The gray areas of overlap. We weren't sure what these were. And you can see some more irregularities, thin points in the walls of the head. It may be possible joins. There's some slight directional changes. And there also appears to be a smear of plaster on the inside of the face that looks like it maybe has finger marks in it. So that's sort of outlined here. And we hope to figure out more about this with CT scanning. So Greg Lynn at the Center for Nanoscale Systems performed micro CT scanning on the object. We were able to leave the portrait packed in its box and put the entire box into the instrument. This is the instrument shown here. And Greg then made a 3D model from the CT data that lets us see inside the portrait. So this is a screenshot from an animation that he made. And we can see so much more here than we could with just the x-ray deographs. And we're really interested to see these regular ridges here which look to be pressed into place in a practiced way. It looks like they're finger marks. And so these are the regularities that we were seeing in the walls in the x-rays earlier. And the view of the model behind the eyes shows us clumps of plaster pressed into place with what look like large and small finger or tool marks. And so this is what we were seeing before when we were seeing this sort of blob behind the eyes. This is the inside surface of that plaster. And Greg also gave us thousands of images that are slice views of the portrait. So now we're, this is a view through the head horizontally below the eyes. You can see the nose at the top of the image. And you can see an added layer of finer plaster on the nose here. And we think this finer plaster was maybe applied after the face was taken out of the mold to further shape and individualize the features as it's described in the literature. But it's also possible that this was maybe applied inside mold before the coarser plaster was pressed in. So it seems that these workshops would have been reusing molds for multiple people's masks and portraits and individualizing these after they came out of the molds. That's one possibility of explaining this finer plaster. And there seem to be possible joints at the ear areas here. And these are what we were looking at visually earlier from the outside. And this is where those pressed panels of plaster converge or come together. And this seems to be where they're meeting with the edge of the face portion. So the the face portion that was made in a mold seems to end in this area area. And then the rest of the back of the heads was filled up with these pressed panels of plaster. So here's a closer look of that ear area. And then this is a slice view farther up through the head closer to the eyes. And you can see the bottom of the plaster that is behind the eyes that has ear marks in it. And here we've moved up yet again. And we're now seeing the glass plates of the eyes which are surprisingly thin. Here's a closer look at that. There is material on the glass behind it. And then there are some voids behind that material which indicates to us the glass is reverse painted rather than being placed over painted plaster. There is paint on actually on the back of the glass that is making up the eyes. So now we switch to the wisey slice view or vertical views sort of right through the nose. And here you can more clearly see that layer of finer plaster on but the nose and also on the chin. And you can see the texture of the applied hair. And now moving across into an eye again. So there seem to be possible seams where material is added behind the eyes. Which suggests it's the only material behind the eyes meetings there would have been a hole in the head. And then the eyes were inserted either from the outside or the inside probably from behind. But we're not completely sure. And then plaster was pressed into place behind those last plates. You can see the void behind the glass again and the plaster behind the glass has curved through it. And the ridge closest to the eyes is probably the edge of that cast face portion. So we talked about the ears being sort of the sides of that cast portion. And this ridge is probably where it ends at the top. That's fine. Well that's great. It's not sure we get to utilize something like a CT scan a far research. But being able to do that through dimensional imaging for this portrait really makes it clear the various stages used in the construction. And you know, if that's giving us a sense of the artist's hand as well. So before we open it up to questions from the audience, my final question to you, hadn't were you able to locate other examples that are similar and could be from the same workshop? Yes. So there are many other portraits that are likely from the same workshop group, including the Rhode Island one on view with the Harvard Mass right now. And there are also other published studies of portraits, often fragmentary portraits that were not previously grouped by workshop in the way that as these research has allowed us to do now. So we can really begin to compare the information that we have about this portrait to research that's been published on other portraits and also seeking out other portraits that we know are from the same workshop grouping. And one really clear similarity is actually the blobs of plaster that we're seeing behind the eyes look a lot like the plaster behind the eyes of this portrait, which is at the Pune's Distourish Museum in Vienna. So this is from a publication where they have photos of different asks in their collection. And this seems to be from the same workshop grouping. And the inside of the rest of the head of that same portrait looks like it may have similar panel structure to what we are seeing on the CT scanning. And so the hope is to continue making comparisons to other portraits that are presumably from the same workshop group as the Harvard portrait again such as this RISD portrait. And we can see how construction differs. And it would also be interesting to compare the portraits that may be from the same mold. So we've talked about these molds being used and ennormolds have been found. But you can sometimes see really distinct similarities between the faces of some of these portraits. And Asim Yulur has suggested that this portrait on the right, which is at the Louvre, may be from the same mold as the Harvard object. So the face may have come out of the same mold. And here are a couple other portraits that I think look similar to that portrait and the Harvard portrait. And everything that we're finding out is contributing to what is known about these portraits and Egyptian human-human-arri portraits in general. So thank you. So this pretty mentioned portrait that hadn't studied is on view in the exhibition. And the coming that we have a digital screen showing some of the images you've seen here today looking at the analysis. And of course, having a route for the digital tool. So here's a chance for us to take some questions. We do have one initial question, haven't. Sandra, Stan is asking if there is on the x-ray looked as though they were moved. But I'm wondering if that's because that's where a lot of the scene and joins are happening. That's a good question. Yes, I don't remember seeing anything that indicated that they were moved. I think that it's a lot of the joining and the plaster that's pressed in the back of the head sort of coming together at that point. But would be something to think about. There's no evidence of repair there, though. So I think probably once that was put on as wet plaster, it would have been difficult to move them after that fact without there being some sort of evidence. Thank you. Good question. That's too any question we have from the audience right now. Well, I will ask Georgina a question. And so far we've only shown today non-invasive methods of looking at this object. But the study did also involve some invasive methods that require taking it small bit of material. And this has done a lot of thought. But I was wondering, Georgina, if you want to talk a little bit about some of the other analysis techniques that we used in this study. Sure, of course, I'd be happy to. So one of the things we did was to look at the plaster and understand what that was. And so what we did is we took the tiny little sample and what we did with our NASA is that we found that it contained gypsum. And what was interesting in that looking at the particles of gypsum within the sample, which you can see in the black and white image, we saw that we have sort of needle shaped particles. And that tells us that the gypsum plaster was used. That means it was molded when the plaster material was damp or wet. And then the gypsum it crystallizes into needles as it dries into this nice hard material. And then the other bit analysis that we were doing was to really understand the application of paint onto the front of the mask. So we took a little sample from the red cloak. And we prepared that as a cross section. And that allows us to look at the layers of paint we touching. And we do that by mounting our little samples into blocks of present and then slicing through it. It's sort of like slicing through a cake and revealing the layers. So the top bright red layer is the surface layer that we see. And it was very ion rich. So we have consistent with the use of a red bokeh pigment. And then the lower surface layer is sort of a more of a light pink paint applied to the neck and the chest area and clearly applied before the cloak. And it contains a mixture of two white pigments called cow sight and huntite. And there's just more amount of red ochre but what's interesting is when you look at the UV you can actually see that within this light of pink paint there's actually two layers that are present. And it's the same materials the same on the outside ion. But they're just in slightly different ratios. So we're able to suggest that there's three paint layers that are applied to the portrait. So that was a really interesting sort snapshot of some of the analysis that we could do. A question from the audience. Has there any signs of retouching restoration work to the portrait? We actually there's a material on the underside. There's a sort of whitish material that we think is probably more recent. I'm not sure we didn't show any quite photos of the underside but actually look through to this. So that is probably the only material that we think was added later. We didn't see any signs of any of the other paint being later restoration or anything like that or differences. So that's one thing that that often stands out when we look at something in UV or different illuminated in different lights. But no actually. And another question. Did you identify any Egyptian blue? We did not find any Egyptian blue. We did look for Egyptian blue. So we used the imaging technique that where Egyptian blue will actually, there's a technique can be used to look for Egyptian blue but no we did not find that. We do have a question asking us a little more about the markings on the back of the RISD portrait and why do you think they're there. Do you want to comment on that or would you like me to do it? You are welcome to. Yeah, to that. I know they're often different. There's iconography on these and it differs a lot in different scenes and thoughts but yeah if you know more about that Georgina please go for it. I know I'm Egyptologist but I'm in talking to Jan who is one of the creative's of the show. We've talked about it so we've moved on to a time when all of the funerary rituals is on the body as opposed to being included with burial goods and so that you having the iconography on the back so it's a it's a mummy on a beer and I forget who it's a flanked on either side but it's it's a way of having the imagery that's important in the funerary practice with the body and so it's put on the back of the neck. That's my best way of up. Jen's chimed in its ISIS and nexus or mourners identify with them. Thank you Jen. Thank you Jen. All right another question is about the reverse painted glass techniques that may have been used on the eyes and then the question is has this been compared perhaps to painted glass portraits or other uses of this method in like antique Egypt? I am not sure about that so I didn't have been done those comparisons. I was mostly focusing on how these portraits were constructive and reading about what people have documented. It's different construction methods for these different kinds of plaster portraits and sometimes the glass is reverse paint and sometimes it seems to not have been reverse painted. There are also opaque glass eyes. There are eyes that sometimes had metal or stone. There are a large variety of ways of putting these making these eyes but no I that's interesting and I haven't read more about comparing it to sort of reverse painting on glass outside of this context. Okay and then the final question we have right now is I'm probably not remembering is there a difference between the finer plaster that was applied as the top coat? I think I remember it still being the gypsum plaster it was just finer and it didn't have as many inclusions in it. I believe that's right everything was gypsum plaster. I know the inclusions varied a little bit color varied a little bit but I think those were the differences so there don't do seem to be different coarseness of plaster that were used intentionally different things were mixed in and they were used for different parts of the construction but it's all gypsum plaster. Well we have a couple of minutes left so if anyone else has any questions please let us know. So how do we have a few minutes left? Is there anything unexpected that you discovered while you were studying this portrait? Yes I will go I hope I don't make everyone sick for these but I have to go back to the end. There one fun thing that we found was these which look like some kind of pest casing and so in conservation we're often worried about pest casings but these don't look like any sort of museum pests that I'm familiar with. So these are in the hair and they seem to be made up of a brown inner layer which you can see in the broken one on the far right and covered in a gray layer which you can see on the other one. So we didn't know what these were so we contacted Richard Pollock who's an entomologist who works as the senior environmental public health officer for Harvard environmental health and safety and he happened to be in the building actually and came and looked at these and identified them as being from a mud dober wasped and so mud dober wasped gathers mud to build a cell and then it stings and paralyzes the spider or insect and puts it inside with an egg and closes it up so when the egg hatches it has a food source and after that eats and grows it forms a cocoon. So the brown material we're seeing is the cocoon and the gray materials the outer mud shell and there are many types of the spined wasp all over the world and they build nests in a variety of shapes. So it is possible that these wasps built their cocoons on us at some point over the last 2000 years but it seems like maybe there's also a sliver of possibility that it's a sliver of possibility that these could be ancient remnants so that was that was kind of fun. Yeah that's very unexpected. All right well I think we're at time well so so thank you for that great conversation. And thank you to everyone who attended today. My co-curators and I hope that you have enjoyed this small series of conversations and Bionary portraits from Roman Egypt facing forward is on you now through the end of December and if you cannot make it to Cambridge we do have a digital tool available on our website the company's exhibition which you can explore. Thank you everyone",

Harvard University is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusetts. The original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge, we pay respect to the people the Massachusetts tribe passed in present and on to the land itself which remains sacred to the Massachusetts people. And I do want to note that we have a wonderful digital collection of artworks that relate to the Native American experience. If you're interested in having a look at that, it's on our website or you can send us a note and we'll send you the link. So I want to welcome everyone to our first in a series of conversations about the exhibition entitled, Fienari Portraits from Roman Egypt, Facing Forward. I'm Jen Thum, Assistant Director of Academic Engagement and Assistant Research Curator at the museums. And I'm one of the co-curators of the exhibition along with my colleague, Susanna Evinghouse, Georgina Rainer, and Kate Smith. And just to note about today's conversation, it is in webinar format. So please enter any questions that you may have in the Q&A box. And we'll speak for about 20 minutes and then have a few minutes at the end for some questions. So today it's my pleasure to be joined in conversation with Kathleen Coleman who is James Lowe professor of the classics here at Harvard. And we'll be discussing one of the courses she teaches entitled, Loss in the context of this exhibition. Very warm welcome to you Kathleen. Thank you Jen. So let's get started. You're a professor of the classics, but you teach this broader course. It's a gen ed course, a general education course. So themes that are meant to stick with Harvard students for the duration of their lives after they leave and go off and do whatever they're going to do next. Can you tell us about that? Why did you decide to teach this course? And what do you hope students will come away with at the end of the semester? Yes, certainly. It came about when the faculty of arts and sciences voted to revamp the general education program. It used to require eight courses. Now it requires four. And I used to teach a course on essentially gladiators. It was called Roman Games. And I was asked whether I wanted to retool that for the new general education program or whether I wanted to offer something new. And we'd been told that they were looking for courses that would prepare the students to face problems they would have to tackle in their lives. And I had one of those sort of flashes of insight and realized that the unthinkable, unmanageable, unfasible problem we'd all face in our lives is loss. So I proposed a course on loss. And it was accepted. And I'm now teaching it for the third time. I taught it in real time in person in for 2019, then on Zoom in spring 2021. And now I'm back in person, which is really wonderful, because there are so many resources that Harvard for me to take the students to and in Cambridge at large, my daughter and cemetery being the obvious one. And we couldn't do that, unfortunately, during the Zoom time. And what do I want the students to get out of this? Well, I have four goals for the course. And one is in so far as it's possible to prepare the students to face losses in their own lives. We don't only deal with bereavement, we also deal with loss of home and exile. And we deal with loss of women. So amputation. We deal also with these ambiguous losses. So when somebody's missing in action or the disappeared politically speaking. And we also deal with those losses when the person's still alive and physically present, but their personality has been altered by the accident, either by accident or by a disease like Alzheimer's. And in the course of examining these various losses, I'm also trying to help the students to develop empathy. And they're young, they're young people, they're going to 18, 19, 20, 21 years old. And many of them have not sustained losses. And all of us, whatever our age, may be, find it very hard to know what to say when someone else has suffered a loss. So we're trying to think of ways to cultivate our own sensibilities and intuit how to react when other people have suffered a loss, whether it's a bereavement or their home has been flooded or something. Thirdly, and in my course, I should explain this in the category of aesthetics. And so my third goal is to introduce the students to great works of literature, which is often active poetry, art, music and architecture that have been born out of loss. Because I want them to realize that they have someone whose hand they can hold. Somebody maybe from long, long, long ago who captured exactly what they are experiencing. And to that end, it's voluntary for the students to contribute something to a scale our site, which we're building over the years of this course, as a resource for people who are suffering from a loss of one sort or another. And my final goal is just very straightforward and it's a carpe, I want them to understand that what you love can be snatched away so quickly and suddenly. And we waste so much of our lives on sort of petty grievances. But you know, it's not worth the risk, clinging to what you love and prepare yourself for how to harvest that emotion and that relationship after it's been physically said that. But a relationship cannot be taken away. We read a lot of op-ed columns and things like that. And there was a wonderful piece we read this week where a woman had a stillbirth just a few weeks before the baby was due. And her mother wrote to her and said, remember that death is the loss of a life, but not the loss of a relationship. You'll always be your baby's mother. That was enormously moving and I think we discussed it a bit in class. I try and teach interactively, even though class has over a hundred students without making it sort of too cumbersome because I want them to realize that they build this class, not just me. So their reactions are really important. Right. And speaking of their reactions, I do just want to quickly show an image of we have from this is in our study gallery before the pandemic, one of the cases of objects that you curated with my colleague Laura Mirror for this course. And this is what that gallery looks like now it's got a mix of classical objects and other objects that speak to loss in various ways. And you've touched on this a little bit, but if you could just say briefly a little bit about what students do in the museum, why is it important to you to incorporate the museums into your course? The museums are absolutely intrinsic to all the teaching that I do, whether it's in the classics department or in the general education program or in humanities 10. The museums are the most astonishing resource of objects and knowledge among the curators. And it's one of the most wonderful things about teaching at Harvard is that we have this museum to use. And I think that you cannot take it for granted that people know how to look at things in a museum. You can't take it for granted that people know how to read a poem for that matter. And so part of what I'm doing in this particular course is helping the students to learn to read objects as well as read poetry and listen to music and so forth. And being able to take them into the gallery and we're looking right now on the right hand side of the screen, we're looking at a funerary steely, a grave from Attica from the fourth century BCE. And maybe we could hop forwards in the yeah, there we got it, wonderful Jen, thank you. Now this is a grave marker from about 333 BCE from Attica in Greece. And the remarkable thing about this, it's a woman dying in childbirth. But that figure standing, clasping her hand, that bearded figure has been recut. And if you look very closely at the head, you can see that the beard is far less protruding than the rest of the profile. And that is because it was a female figure, it was a nurse, a standard figure in these sort of kind of what you might call hospital scenes. And it's been recut to be presumably the husband. And so I think that raises such interesting questions. I mean, first of all, I've got the students to describe what they can see. And many of them will not have noticed that this is a male figure, but eventually they will notice it. And then we will talk about what it means to reuse somebody else's grave monument. And why did somebody buck the trend, if you like, go swim against the tide and instead of leaving the standard feature of the nurse, they're interacting with the woman in in labor, in fatal labor, as it turns out, why did he insert himself or why did somebody insert him in this image. And so it gets the students to think about how loss partly precipitates sort of conventional reactions. And partly can absolutely destroy convention and require a personal response. That's quite unique. I want to bring up just because you've used this object in particular, something that really struck me, you mentioned empathy earlier. I'm sure if you know this, but we teach a program for radiology, rather than sub-regum and women's hospital at the museum, then we use this very same object to talk about empathy. We post a question of whether or not, even if you are someone who can never have a child or has never had a child, can you feel for this woman and her family? And does the fact that there's a fragmentary inscription, which just says that she's a daughter, but not who she is, does knowing that she's a daughter, increased her empathy, does it tell you something, and this relates to how doctors and their patients have this relationship where if the radiologist, you know, is a little bit more about the personal individual life of their patient, they become more than just an image. Right. And because it says that she's a daughter, and we don't have the rest of her name, are we wrong to assume that the male figure is her husband, could the male figure be her father? Right. So all sorts of questions are to develop. And yes, absolutely, the empathy. And I like particularly the raised left hand, which looks so stylized, it looks like one of those gestures that sort of has a repertoire of fixed meaning. But I want the students to realize, and this relates obviously to all issues of ritual, that these stylized gestures and stylized scenes are a human way of responding to loss, and they become sort of cliches because they're so effective. That's why a key share is a key share because people have found it useful. And so seeing that that hand raised their represents a gesture that we can't fully unpack, but it conveys something of the pathos at the moment. I want to change tack a little bit now to talk more about the Finnery Portraits exhibition and your take on loss in this context. And just to show everyone what the gallery looks like now, this is on our university research gallery. This is actually right, just two galleries over from where you have your installation right now for the lost class. So you can see a variety of, so for example, the wooden panel portraits, a Finnery shroud, and then the sculptural plaster portraits as well in this space. Many people are familiar with some type of Egyptian Finnery material because it's most of what survives and what makes it into museums. My sense is that people aren't usually thinking about loss when they encounter those objects though, but more about curiosity and fascination and maybe history. So how do you think we might encourage visitors to think about some of the themes of your course when they encounter Finnery objects, Egyptian or otherwise, in a museum? Well, I think the place to start is with two people. The Finnery object was made for somebody or to commemorate somebody who's died, but it was made by somebody who's alive or commissioned by somebody who's alive. And then the actual maker would be a third party in most cases. But I think it's really important to remember that this object in a sense is a memorial to somebody who has died whether it's probably a grave good, so a vase or something like that. It may not be an actual portrait like this one, but it was made because somebody cared enough and spent enough money to get it made and wanted to perpetuate the existence of the deceased person. That death is the end of physical life, but it's not the end of the relationship, and that relationship is sustained by the portrait surviving on the the fume remains. And just sort of thinking about objects reminds me of Finnery rituals, and this is also something that I feel like a lot of people are familiar with Egyptian Finnery rituals, such as the opening of the mouth or the modification, just because of the way they figure in pop culture, or you learn about them as a child in school. And this, you know, thinking about the relationship building and ritual, can you say a bit about why rights of passage are so important in the context of law? Well, one word that I think I want to avoid in this context is the word closure, because of this idea that the relationship will be sustained in perpetuity. So it's not that with these rituals we're looking for closure, but we're looking for a sort of a dignified way to mark the transition to a new stage of the relationship. And I think just as with cliches, so these ritualized practices are a great, great help because they connect one to the broader society that has passed before one, one's own day, and will continue into the future. And that is why we have, you know, there's the fixed pattern usually of a funeral where you get comfort from the stages that the funeral goes through and the different funerals obviously for different cultures and different religions. But having a map as it were, an emotional map that you can follow in these rituals, I think helps to navigate this extraordinary, difficult transition when we transition from having a relationship with someone who's alive to having to sustaining that relationship in an entirely new sphere. Yeah, it really is just a change in relationship, just renegotiating the social structure. Yeah. And this, you know, makes me think a little bit about our relationship, the visitor and museum's relationship to objects like this portrait. In the exhibition, we made an effort to fill the space with ancient names. We did this by borrowing some objects that do have ancient names on them, although they're unfortunately there are different people than the portraits show. It's has to do with the fragmentation of these objects and the separation from their bodies for time. But we made an effort to fill that space with ancient names and to display some of the portraits horizontally and gesture to the absent body and to get visitors thinking about the role of memory and what they're seeing. The goal was to remember and respect the ancient deceased people who are present in this space. Do you think that we can remember and even more in these losses effectively in our own time, even though most of the portrait subjects are anonymous to us and we didn't know them personally? Can we have that relationship? Well, remember is a difficult word because normally when we say remember, we mean someone we knew or something we knew and forgotten and now we remember it. And so it's hard to remember somebody you've you've you've never known but to cultivate the memory of someone you've never known, I think is perfectly possible. And this gorgeous portrait we're looking at right now on the screen, it's just so individualized. And if you you know walked out of Harvard yard and you met this person on the street, you would instantly recognize them. And with that that frontal gaze, the title of the exhibition facing forward, you really feel a connection with that person. She's looking right at us. And she's wearing those beautiful earrings. I loved the way the exhibition explains how the red the little red jewel in the center of each earring was created with those layers of paint. And so I think it is possible to have a relationship of a sort simply by trying to bridge the the millennia in this case by acknowledging that this person lived, died and lives on in the cultural memory of that society. When we're you know, de-racingating these these portraits from the place they were meant to to reside for the rest of time, obviously that raises difficult issues of interference with the dead and that kind of thing. But one of the things that people who who studied bereavement and loss are emphasizing a lot these days is making meaning out of loss. And it could be me as a scholar, you know, trying to rationalize the study of these things. But I do feel that in an extraordinary for a society, in our case, on a continent, they couldn't even have dreamed of when this person was alive. So that it's not as though the survivors, the direct descendants of this woman are there to feel a tremendous sort of a violation, if you like, of her resting place. Those those persons don't exist anymore. But we are the the errors, if you like, to the acknowledgement of of her life and are obliged to respect the knowledge that she is delivering to us about her society across more than two, well, in this case, not quite 2000 years. It is so, I'm just going to sound very naive, it is so incredible that we know anything about the lives of the people who lived in Roman Egypt. Our curatorial team has thought a lot about that. How do we make meaning from these particular objects without feeling that we're violating the person that they depict. And we found a lot of our meaning in trying to learn as much as we can about them and share that knowledge, as you say. And but, you know, necessarily this this required us to do scientific analysis on the portraits. And so we have a curator statement at the beginning of the exhibition, for example, that talks about how we acknowledge that we end freezing visitors actively benefit from the dismantling of these objects. But it's sort of a question of, well, they're they're here. Can how can we what can we do to to learn as much as we can from them to use this as an example of harmful archaeological practices at the hospitals, which learn about the artists in the past. So we have this scientific analysis. It's a major part of the exhibition. It's a major part of research on scenery portraits of this type, the world over, especially now, we're part of this international research project called appear that is doing that when you feel about the relationship between the modern response to ancient loss and that scientific element is this troubling at all. Or how does it sort of how does the science does the science jive with with with with memory with loss. Well, the science makes meaning in its own way because without these these objects, we wouldn't have the scientific explanation. We wouldn't have the material to make these discoveries. And so I think it's obviously different if it's so recent that there are living descendants of these these people who would object and then one would obviously honor their objections. But in the case of material like this, I think so long as one is very respectful of the the loss that was entailed in the death of the person. And now in a sense a new loss, which which is represented by however fragmentary that the removal of a little grain of sand sized piece of pigment, I was so impressed in the exhibition, those little pieces of pigment that you see under the microscope are just like a grain of sand in size. But that tells us so much. And one would hope that if the society was still present and intact, it would acknowledge that this is part of the gift of that life so long ago that it gives us knowledge today. But as I say, it has to be done respectfully. And I think starting from recognizing this was a real person and they died. And that must have caused grief because otherwise somebody wouldn't have gone to the trouble of making the painting and spending all the money and so on. That's where we have to begin not by saying, aha, opportunity for scientific discovery and then waiting in. I think, you know, it's a two-step process. Right. That's excellent. I have one final question for you before we see if there are any audience questions. And that's just what would you encourage people to keep in mind when they look at this exhibition, when they can visit or engage with similar material elsewhere? I think I would encourage people to recognize that even an emotion as a fundamental as grief is culturally determined. There are cultural elements in antiquity and I tried to say this on the little thing that I wrote for the website. In antiquity, life was much more fragile than it is today. People died much younger. They died more frequently, so to speak. And so there was a kind of acceptance about the inevitability of death that we can fight against now because we have all these amazing hospitals and medical interventions that keep people alive long after they would have been alive in antiquity. I'm pretty probably most of us who watching this webinar or participating in this webinar wouldn't actually be around today if we were living 2000 years ago. We would have died of whatever the doctors saved us from when we were kids. And so that's one thing that I would encourage people to do try and think that this is a human constant loss and grief, but there are ways in which cultures respond as determined by their own circumstances. And when you think of that, then you look at this portrait and you think it was obviously really important for her portrait to show her best earrings. I think those are beautiful gold earrings with the pearls and those little are they gone. It's I'm not sure what the red stones are supposed to represent. And so that says something about this yearning for status in the next life and a demonstration of well-being and of a place in society, which I'm not sure, most of our gravestones don't have a portrait anymore. And if they do, they're probably not quite so frankly, advertising will be a moment. We asked this question at the end of the exhibition. I'll come along with some others for visitors to give their feedback. How do you want to remember your loved ones? How do you want them to remember it? And a lot of that is about how this image of them may be having a mind. So I'm good to see if we have any questions from the audience. Oh yes, okay. So I'm going to answer the first one if it's okay. It's about the appear project. Can you say a little bit about the appear international project? What is it about? So it is, let me see if I can get this right, ancient panel paintings, examination and research project. It's headquartered at the Gettie Museum and it's an international effort to establish patterns throughout the corpus of Funerie Portraits. There are about a thousand that are known today and only about a hundred of them are still attached to the physical remains of the people they depict. And so a lot of, and most of them, I think it's fair to say, most of them do not have a secure archaeological fine spot due to harmful past practices. So one of the ways that we can try to understand, for example, what local workshops were doing and about the availability and cost of materials and trends and even artists individual workshops. Thank you, Matthew. Just put in the chat the link to the project. One of the ways to do that is to look at, look for patterns between them. So the hope is that with our data, which is, it's comes from different types of imaging, for example, X-rays of the paintings to determine whether or not there is an underdrawing. Or so it's ultraviolet imaging to determine if there's an underdrawing or X-rays to determine how thick the brush is that they're making the strokes with things like this that we can pin down which artists are doing one in which region and maybe this can help us understand a little bit more about the artists and how these paintings were built. Thank you for that question. So let's see, oh, we have a question for you, Kathleen. Do you ever engage with post-mortem photography in your course? A tiny bit, tiny bit. We look at image quite a lot and we do look at a couple of photographs from the 19th century of corpses, beautifully laid out with beautiful clothing and that kind of thing. But it's not a major theme, but it is part of the image base that I'm exploring with the students. And we try, I do give them something to read about that so that they can understand the cultural context in which those photographs were believed to be okay. And I get the students to think about whether they would be okay now. Right, that change in perspective and time and even in geography is important. It's important for us to reflect on that with the psyched admissions, well, for very similar reasons. Thank you for that, Anne, sir, Kathleen. I've got another one for you. Can you please discuss the disruption of normal funerals during the pandemic and whether the delayed shared grief can ever be experienced? Yeah, again, I give the students something to read about this that the those normal morning rituals were completely withdrawn from the mourners. And that I think has obviously had a very damaging effect on many people's um ability not to get over the loss. We never talk about getting over the loss, but to accommodate the loss. And I think one of the things that people may be trying to do is to um to create a substitute for those missing rituals and that now so many years further on, it's possible to have a kind of commemoration which may be without the body obviously or without the scenery, for the cremated remains, but it can nevertheless be a gathering where a lot of thought is put into how to commemorate the person and how to try and shrink that long gap of time between the before time and now when we had the pandemic making it impossible for us to grasp the the supports that we would normally expect when we're moved. That's a new year, I'd like to take one more question. You were just a couple minutes over time. Um, so uh Anthony is asking, knowing that ancient children, such as a sibling or friend would see the portraits of their fellow youth who passed, how am I going to child or a young teen react with process this? And they said, I know this requires you to speculate. Well, um, again, I think from a very young age, children in antiquity were being acculturated to the idea that life was very fragile and uncertain and um that's why people had so many children because you know they were expected many of them not to make it to adulthood and parents had to have as it were an insurance against their old age when they would depend on our children to look after them. So that I think that the surviving children would have um in a sense been maybe less shocked by the death of a of a sibling and the visible sort of memorial uh and but but nevertheless obviously it would have been an emotional loss depending on the relationship. That's another thing that we look at quite a lot in my course is that um it's not all sweetness and and and honey when somebody's died. There can be so many regrets and um sort of nascent to satisfactions and then people fight over funeral rituals and and then they'll fight over the will and they fight over everything. So you know we try and look also at how loss can actually cause a lot of friction. It's not people all coming together and being helpful. They're often very unhelpful. Um and so I think that um it is speculation obviously and we don't. I'm trying to think whether we do have any evidence for what an ancient any evidence an ancient child sort of relating to the the death of a sibling. But there is very interesting research. It's been done anthropological research in Brazil in the 1980s in some of these favelas where there are these massive numbers of children being born to women who are themselves so impoverished that they then undernourished and they and that they can't support all the children. Some of them they just allow to die and um I I'm assuming that some research has been done on actually interviewing the the surviving children about what they thought of the the loss of the sibling and the but the mourners I remember this distinctly the mourners are asked not to grieve for the deceased child but to admire the beauty of the little child in its coffin. That's an acceptance that this is someone and I'm going to mispronounce her name because I don't know how it's pronounced. Nancy Shaper Hughes her research done in the 1980s was really significant one a huge award. She's an associate anthropologist um who's done this work in Brazil and it's a very important work and I think is helpful for understanding antiquity too. Right. Kathleen thank you so much. We do have a few people were asking about reading recommendations. I'm wondering if uh if we're able to we'll check with this with you Matthew. We're able to send out a follow-up email if you wouldn't mind sending a few reading recommendations from what your students read in your course and also some of us being musical pieces if you don't mind recommending some but we can follow up with you on that to send them to to those who attended Matthew says yes we can do that great. So thank you so much again and I want to just tell everyone here that our next conversation is on October 12th and it will be um about a pigment in the Forbes pigment collection that has a very complicated past and relates to exhibition you can be more about it online. So this is our calendar listing and we've got several more of these conversations to come. Thank you so much again Kathleen it's been a pleasure and we look forward to hearing your reading recommendations. Sure and thank you so much for having me and can I just say the exhibition is just so beautifully curated and I hope everybody who's been on this web and novel go and see it. Thank you so much Kathleen. Bye bye.",
16,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:LEG277810?width=3000&height=3000,Gangsta Girl on the Block,Arlene Shechet,2012,"So good evening and welcome. I'm Martha Tadeski, the director of the Harvard Art Museums, and I'm delighted to see all of you here with us tonight and also to offer a special welcome to the artist, Arlene Shekett, who you'll hear from in a moment, and to the German friends of the Bush Risinger Museum who are with us here from Germany for this special event. Would you all raise your hands, our German friends? A round of applause. They are the supporters of this very important museum of the constellation of three, the fog, our Asian Art Museum, and the Bush Risinger friends, our stalwarts, and they all are in Germany, follow what we're doing carefully and every once in a while, like today, they come to check on how we're doing. So, as is our practice before we start our program, I want to offer a land acknowledgement. Harvard University is located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusetts, the original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge. We pay respect to the people of the Massachusetts tribe, Pasadam present, and honor the land itself, which remains sacred to the Massachusetts people. Thank you. We are delighted to welcome celebrated sculptor, Arlene Shekett, as our esteemed guest for tonight's Leventritt lecture. The artist's exhibitions and awards are too numerous to mention right now because I know you're here to hear from her, not from me. But I do want to tell you that Arlene Shekett is likely familiar to many of you, not least of all due to the wonderful mid-career retrospective all at once, at the ICA Boston in 2015. How many of you had a chance to see that exhibition? Great. I see a lot of... Arlene, you probably saw it, didn't you? I see a lot of hands in the audience. Her work is represented in major museum collections, such as the Met, the her shore, and the ICA Boston, and the Los Angeles County Museum, and the Harvard Art Museums, as we were able to acquire her work casserole for our exhibition in 2018, and you'll hear more about that quite soon. She joins us here in Cambridge from Kingston, New York, where she has her main studio. And she has already had a great session with students yesterday, which is an important part of the Leventritt lecture program. It's a public lecture, but it's also a chance for the artist to meet with Harvard students on campus. The installation disrupt the view Arlene Shekett at the Harvard Art Museums opened on July 2nd. In it, Shekett presents her work. Her recent work alongside historical German, Japanese, and Chinese porcelain objects from our own collections here at Harvard. It will be on view in our permanent collection gallery, on level one of the Bush Rising or Galleries for a three-year period. So I hope you will have the chance to revisit it multiple times over time, noticing new and playful and telling juxtapositions with every visit. This project came about during the pandemic lockdown. So our staff was in isolation, even from each other, as well as from our collections for the most part. So I want to take a special moment to recognize the many members of our museum team who helped to realize the artist's vision. These include the curatorial department, collections management, communications design, editorial, facilities, security, the Strauss Center for Conservation and Technical Studies, and visitor services. Please join me in thanking them for their contributions to this exciting collaboration with the artist. The installation and related programming are supported by the Charles Coon Endowment Fund in the Bush Rising or Museum. Support for the event tonight is also provided, as I said, by the M Victor Leventritt Fund, which was established through the generosity of the wife, children, and friends of the late M Victor Leventritt, who was in the class, a Harvard class of 1935. The purpose of this fund is to present outstanding scholars of the history and theory of art to the Harvard and greater Boston communities. Modern and contemporary art programs at the Harvard Art Museums are also made possible by the generous support of the Emily Rao Pulitzer and Joseph Pulitzer Junior Fund for Modern and Contemporary Art. And now, with those thanks, Dooley recorded, it is my great pleasure to introduce Arlene Checkett and our dimelayer curator of the Bush Rising or Museum, Lynette Roth, who spearheaded this project. Please join me in welcoming them both to the stage. Thank you. Okay. Welcome, everyone. And thank you, Martha, for that kind introduction. And I just want to echo Martha's thanks to our entire staff at the Harvard Art Museums and also to Arlene, of course, and to Arlene's incredible team, because it really did take a lot of Zoom calls and a lot of sketch-up mockups and all different ways for us to work together in ways that we actually don't like to work, like to work with objects and together. And so it really was a testament also to Arlene to your commitment to the Bush Rising or Museum to the Harvard Art Museums that you really stuck with us through a pandemic exhibition planning process. We stuck with each other. It helped that we knew each other a little from before. Right. And that's actually so I just wanted to say, you know, this is actually been beyond even before the pandemic, a collaboration with Arlene that's been really long and the making, at least in my mind, because the Bush Rising or Museum has an incredible collection of 18th century porcelain, primarily from the Mison Manufactury, which was the first European manufacturing of porcelain founded in 1710. And I'm actually a specialist for the art of the 20th and 21st century. So needless to say, although my collection included this extensive 18th century porcelain collection, I really, let's just say I didn't really know how to get into it. And as an artistorian who's thought a lot about the relationship between art and politics and really what art can do in order to affect a social change, I was a bit puzzled primarily by many figures of the working class that were in our holdings that were made and created for lavish aristocratic celebrations in the 18th century. And as they're typically shown in museum contexts, for example, our coppersmith here from the Bush Rising or Collection was shown in our second level silver cabinet gallery. And there is porcelain still on view on level two in our 18th century galleries that you can see. But I thought, okay, how can we kind of disrupt the view? And I knew exactly who I should ask because Arlene, you and I had met. Martha mentioned the ICA exhibition. And at the time, we invited you to come to our art study center, which was relatively new at the time. And do an art study seminar, which as you can see, was sold out in like five seconds. Everybody was very interested to hear Arlene speak. And what surprised me at the time was actually I thought you would select works of porcelain for us to talk about. But actually, you ended up saying you wanted to focus on something else. Yeah. Well, we did talk about porcelain. We did talk about porcelain. We did talk about porcelain, but I was interested. I am interested in how a material that's been sequestered within museums, but also within art history can play with other things. And I have a particular interest in German art between the wars. And I know that Lynette has a great knowledge of that. So I said, I think if we pull some of those drawings out, we're going to find a kind of lightness and darkness that overlaps with the attitude of some of these porcelain figures. And so we did. We did. And it was actually then, I think in some ways foreshadowing of this working together, because then, of course, when we had our gallery, which is right off of our expressionist and interwar galleries of German art here at the museums, I knew that Arlene was approaching it, not just from the perspective of putting porcelain in a new context, but also putting our broader collections in new relationships with our sculpture collections more broadly. And the fact that actually already in your ICA exhibition all at once were porcelain figures from the Bush Risinger Museum collection meant that, you know, you were already familiar with our holdings before we sort of even got started on this project. Yeah. When I did the ICA show, and I think even when I did the RISD Museum show, I started to examine what was in the collections of all neighboring museums. And so what we could borrow, or at least what I could look at in order to understand better the subject matter. So in some ways, this is a teaser for we're going to get into some of Arlene's installations over really the last decade of your engagement with Myson, but I thought maybe let's start at the beginning of your engagement with porcelain, and that was literally in Myson in Germany. And I was hoping you could just tell us a little bit about what brought you there and what you found. Yeah. So I was invited in a very open-ended invitation by Peter Negi, who is a multifaceted figure in the art world, being a dealer and artist, and also a well-respected curatorial force. And somebody had approached him, and he had a gallery at the time, not just in India, where he lives, but in Berlin. And somebody in Berlin had approached him asking if there was an artist who might be interested in working at the Myson porcelain factory without having to, and this is important, without having to make something that they would produce as a product. Because there are many such programs where you're invited as an artist, but end up needing to create something that is producible. And I didn't want to do that, because I didn't even know what I wanted to do. And I had never worked in porcelain, but I thought if I'm going to ever work in porcelain, I want to go to ground zero of what that means, which is definitely the place in 1710, where it all started, and where the porcelain itself is so beautiful, just with nothing happening. You know, it's just exquisite material, because porcelain is not the same all over. And many of you know that, but it is not like product. Every factory, every in China, it's different from Japan and Korea. Every every porcelain is different, and every place that makes porcelain. So on the left, this is a 16th century town of Myson, where I lived, I had an apartment at the right near the church, which is one of the sites that had was the original factory. And then there is this was my walk into the factory building, which is a classic, slightly brutalist, but I loved it, industrial architecture of the early 20th century. I love this image of you walking down the steep hill every day into the factory. You should think about me walking home late at night, through completely empty streets of this town. So I actually rift on that experience in this slide. On the right, I took a picture of that view of the factory, and I tried to use the same glaze as this 18th century piece on the left, but to do instead of Bavarian, wonderful Bavarian mountains, just the Myson factory. And so this is a factory, very exciting for me, that making multiples is what they do. So they have been using the same molds since the 18th century to make multiples of various things. They don't use everything. Whatever they decided their product line is any particular year. So it changes, but this is what it's not surprising that this is what the factory looks like. But for me, I had long fantasies as a child of working in factories, which my husband jokes with me is like, are you done yet? Where you really understood the means of production, really understood how things were made. And I feel like that impulse to understand how things were made was the tip off that I was going to be a sculptor, like it or not. And not just process, but also production. I mean, this was really, these were the kinds of imagery where I had actually visited the Myson factory as a tourist. You can kind of take a tour and go through and learn how porcelain is made. But these were not the scenes that I saw of the Myson factory. And when started talking to Eurlean about it and actually starting to think about this idea of porcelain as something that is a multiple unlimited, still, you know, same molds are being used today to produce, you know, literally the same forms. And yet the handmade quality and the artistry and all of the aspects of it that you were bringing out in your work. That's where, again, sort of my way in was to start thinking about it in terms of labor. And I know these interests of yours, experiencing the factory and how things worked there. Yeah, the idea of luxury goods, rubbing, rubbing, rubbing up against industrial processes. So maybe we can talk a little bit about those processes, but also, you know, how porcelain is made, because it's so key to really appreciating where you ended up taking the media. Well, would I, I realized now and explaining it that most people don't know that all these, that it begins as a liquid. It doesn't, the, the porcelain itself does not begin as a liquid, it begins as powders, you know, chop down or dug up, like various powders. I've learned now, I've learned now, Kaleen, Feldspar and Quartz. Yes. If I learned one thing from the tutorial fellow, Gabi Saleh, it is. Yes. Those three elements make porcelain. But in different, different Kaleen from different regions will make different porcelain. So all, so British porcelain is very different from German porcelain, because the, the, the minds are different. So yes, three major elements, but don't forget, people didn't know that before, before the 18th century. In America, in Germany, they, or in Europe, they only knew it in the east, you know, where it had been China, Japan, it had been in production for hundreds and hundreds of years. So anyway, liquid, they add water, it's, it's a liquid and in, um, and every day in my studio, somebody would come and put his hand in just like that to feel if it was correct. And that material is called slip. The slip is then poured into plaster molds. And the plaster molds with these bindings are held together with various bindings. How are the negative of the shape that people are trying to make in the factory? And here, this is the pretty version of the archives. It's beautiful. Yeah, of the mold archives. You know, thousands of molds? No. By the time I was there at the end of two years, I had, I was in buildings that, you know, flies were all over everything. You know, there are, it's, it's the DNA of the factory. It's a DNA of my son. It's their most precious legacy. And it's all over the place. They have, um, there was a big flood. I can't remember the date, but they plaster can handle the water. So it actually survived. We're as many other things did not survive. That's what was so exciting to hear about your time there because you had access to, I mean, again, you know, it was a, it was a very competitive market. It still is secrets are kept very close. And so the fact that you had really free reign at which you, I know you worked very hard for over time, but to not only explore these spaces, but really to use these historic molds to make your own. Yeah. Yeah. So when, when I went, what do we have next? Is this? Yeah. So this is after a period of time, the slip is released from the mold. And that's when, and each mold has a, has a time, time to a certain moment. And that's when the object can come out. I think we, here, here we are. But I'll explain what I ended up doing. So the first few weeks of being around, I was just trying to digest what it meant to be at my son, what it meant to be around porcelain. And what I realized was the thing that I loved was the production, the thing that I loved was the means of production, which were the molds. So the industrial forms, I loved much more than the finished forms that they were trying to make. I knew I would play with that, but I would, I was fascinated by the molds. So if we go back one there, so I basically took their molds, made in plaster, I made my own plaster molds of their plaster molds. Again, my husband says nobody understands this, but my own plaster molds, and I cast those industrial plaster molds into porcelain. And I rift off of the classic painted patterns in order to bring it back to this, my symbocabulary. So the slide before you saw my assistant making the mold of the mold, like figuring out how to make it. There it is on the right. That's the original. And then the next one is what I produce, which to me, I was just in heaven, it looked like the perfect cover jar, of course it had nothing to do with what that mold was really for. Nothing. It was some tiny little, not interesting object as far as I was concerned, but the, the, and this little detail here is also me painting an onion, that blue and white pattern is called the onion pattern in America, and it's in misnomer, because they in, as I said, everything that the Europeans learn, they learn from Asia. And really the, those cultures were thinking about persimmons or pomegranates, which they didn't have in Germany, so they just assumed it was an onion. So I was celebrating the onion. So every time somebody would say onion pattern, I just laugh. So I use that. And I think, you know, here also you had mentioned before, maybe it's an opportunity to talk about the insignia at my son as well. So my son, porcelain, most of what we have in the installation is, if it's not Chinese or Japanese, because we wanted to point back to the fact that porcelain had been around since the Tang Dynasty, and the Europeans were really trying to figure out the formula, but that at my son this cross-sword insignia is basically how they both, you know, identify their product and also make sure that no one else is trying to pass off their product, and they were very particular about that with you as well. Yeah, they have, they have people at the manufacturing who only sign. And after I was there for a week, they said, okay, time to sign. I was like, time to sign. I often do not even sign my artworks because they're archived, but the signature, I understood why this signature was important because of this whole history of theft related to the formula. And there is a wonderful book that I think you got that's in the bookstore. Janik Lee Sin's Arcanum. Yeah, they are canyons. Really, I mean, it reads like a detective, not, I mean, it is, and it's all the history of my son, you know, Buddha locked in the tower, and so it's definitely a worthwhile read. Yeah, it's a worthwhile read, and you still, there's still a vibe of that. And you read that before you went to me? Yeah, I read it just as I was about to leave. So I had a sense in place. So this is more again of the mold, like that would be the mold up there on the left with the yellow, and then my playing around, my, having cast that mold into porcelain and that's it before on the right, before it's fired. And you can see I use the numbers I use, like I love the molds that were very used. I cast in every chip, every drip, every, you know, any, any relationship to use, but everything was numbered starting in the 18th century. And so this piece you might recognize is in this show upstairs. And this piece is, this is us making the, making the casserole. And this was the biggest mold that they had ever done. They, because all of my pieces, because I was doing a mold of a mold, my pieces were way larger than their pieces. And so this was a big challenge. But the, the craftsmen there are so devoted to solving problems. And most of the time, and so clever and have been trained so much, but most of the time they have no problems to solve, because they're doing, have been doing the same thing over and over again. So when I came, I said, let's solve this problem. They actually really got behind me. And, and the first, when I did the first mold of a mold, and I showed, showed the porcelain, the, the, the, the man who had made the original mold, started to start to weave. You know, because, because these are people who are not really recognized. So this level of factory worker felt and should feel elevated by that work. This is at the RISD Museum. And the first time I had this piece out, and they had a cup there that has that brick pattern. And the piece I made atop is somewhat a nomage to that. And that's the work that, that we were able to acquire for the museum in 2018, as, as Martha mentioned. And because it had this direct connection, it was obviously a wonderful example to start, to build our collection of, of your work, Arlene. And here it is upstairs in the gallery. And this was really for me, then, a vocative, because, you know, you talk about the molds of the molds and, you know, unlimited multiples and the attention then to, to the painting and the surface decoration, but then to be able to take from our own collection, like you did. Other multiples. So multiple terines, as you see, sort of flanking Arlene's work on either side, right? Really sort of started to drive that, that point home. Yeah. So that my mold form, my casserole form would have been, when it was in plaster in the factory, would have been used to make the bottom of those pieces, those, cast those, uh, terines that are there. So the, the re-enighting of these things is, is really amazing. So this is more of that story where I'm, you know, doing that, that same thing. And, and then I worked with some more figurative things. And here's the butger on the right, really in the factory that picture was taken in the factory. But this is a portion of the mold, the positive part of the mold that was used to make these bears. And then... And we touched on it just a little bit, but maybe while we have this slide up to ask. So we talked about how it was a struggle for, um, the Germans at the time to figure out the recipe for, the white hard porcelain, which was, you know, such a luxury project product. It was called white gold. And that the butger porcelain that we see here, this kind of red stoneware was a kind of byproduct of that. And it was interesting to me that you went that far, sort of back into the history. Was that something that you were learning about while you were at mice? Well, I already knew that, uh, they, I knew the history of porcelain. So I knew the brown stuff came first, uh, before they were able to figure out the white stuff. Um, and, uh, that it was very, that now it's very rare to find it. And in fact, uh, they, at the, at the manufacturing, they have a separate small facility only to produce that. And they had stopped doing it, um, uh, because that's not what people want to know about or care about. You know, they stopped promoting it and nobody really, you know, unless you're a geek, you know, you're not, that's not, that's not being asked for. So I had, I spent quite a lot of time getting to know the people who ran those kilns and would possibly help me make it. So I was actually very heavily involved in getting them to make these few pieces that I was able to make. Because I think it's a wonderful material. It's so dense, you know, porcelain is really then becomes a stone again once it's fired so high and so long. So for those of you who don't know, it's thousands and thousands of degrees. It takes a, like, pretty much a week to fire it up and fire it and cool it out. And so it's a, it's a big production, but the, you know, the density of it and the sheen, like the one in the, in the gallery, it's totally unglazed. Like there's nothing on it and it's, you know, it's, it's gorgeous. Uh, these, this is just my workstation with some of the, all these salts, basically, they're glazes or, all these salts. I didn't know, you know, what was going on, but I dabbled heavily. Uh, and, you know, was able to come up with things like this that were mysterious to the people working because they were doing very strict and straight stuff. Um, and I was doing things like taking handfuls of the actual minerals and, you know, putting it on raw, they would melt. I mean, the kiln master finally, you know, cut down, cut me down a little bit, but, uh, because the, the powders were flying all over the kiln. But it was really exciting. This piece is at, it's, it's here, but it was really wonderful to work with that, with their, they have amazing kilns there that again, very, very knowledgeable people who have have, are, and there it is. Uh, this, this series that I worked on, um, that has all of the little forms there are throwaways. So at night, I would go to people's tables, work tables, and I'd pull things out of the garbage. Um, and because they're all, they're all throwaways, but sprues or things like that from the means of production. So it was all part of that same thing. Like what is being thrown out became much more interesting to me. And also my hope was really to make it interesting to everybody. Like what you're doing is actually amazing. This spru might, might seem like nothing, but it's, you know, it's, it's really special, a special form. And I would imagine that these things were sculpt, I call them sculpture gardens, and that they were you know, really what I was making was, uh, giant gigantic sculptures. Uh, so I actually did make large sculptures, but it took a long time. And here's some, it just, I love this um, photo of you at work. Yeah, so as you know, a lot, you can write, you can draw in pencil on, on, on, on porcelain when it fires out, when it fires, the pencil goes away. So I could just sketch, sketch things out that were my a riff. And this form, which is a kind of bowl, was actually the lid, the mold for the lid of the terrain. So yeah, now we're getting into sort of how you're thinking about, about these objects in space. Well, I'm thinking about, so, so I think the way we, I think I think about it is the, there's the material and how, how the forms are made, but then there is the relationship to institutions and the public. How, how are things presented? Uh, and so while I was still at the factory, the person who invited me asked me to do a show at his Berlin gallery, and I decided as part of it to only use the things from the factory, all of the furniture from the factory, which took some convincing to get it out, because, you know, it's, most of it was there from the 18th or 19th century, and they were embarrassed about it. And I was trying to tell it. And then I think in the, in this one you can see, I'm actually foregrounding those objects. I'm just, I'm not just putting things on them. I'm actually showing them as, as things. Because this is what I felt, this is why people aren't looking at this stuff. Like these are actually artists who make amazing things, made amazing things, and they are marginalized institutionally, or people don't get to get close enough to them, to see it react to that feel it. And so, you know, that's my, that's been my point of view. I mean, also marginalized as the decorative arts in general, which I know is something, you know, that, that was also the reason why when we were thinking about where it made sense to do this installation, it was actually very important to, to take it completely out of the context of the 18th century, but also to take it out of, I'm putting it in galleries where, yeah, basically, I mean, we've added extra sort of signage because people don't expect the, you know, Arlene Checkett, a porcelain installation to be literally off of our expressionism and inner-ward German, you know, primarily painting and sculpture galleries. Yeah, to give it equal footing, and I have a lot of theories related to, you know, this, sometimes this was seen as women's work, and porcelain having a, even though it was men who made most of it, you know, feminine vocabulary around it. So, and the whole term decorative arts, it is a term that I feel I can embrace totally like decorative art, I love it, but I do think from a historical or institutional point of view, it is problematic. And one of the great things about that with the Bush Risinger Museum is actually the decorative arts as such have always been integrated into the museum's collection. I mean, we're likely best known for our Bauhaus collections, but also dating back to the origins of the collection. A lot of this work was always shown in combination, so it's, you know, it's kind of a great legacy. Yeah, no, Harvard has really been at the forefront of that. This is at the RISD Museum, where they had an amazing paneled porcelain room that had not, that they were in the process of thinking about dismantling, even though Abbey Elge which Rockefeller had given all this amazing stuff and all the paneling was beautiful, but nobody had touched it in 30 years and they were only using it for receptions. And we should say this was your first beyond the Berlin exhibition that we showed exhibition where you really worked with a museum collection. And actually, I got that little pamphlet in the mail. Oh, was that 2015 or something? And that was actually, oh, no, even before that, before that. It was before that. And I thought, ah, this is interesting. Knowing I had this porcelain collection. Yeah, yeah. So they, so I started, that's when I started to play, they're a collection. I, in the process of doing this exhibition, I discovered they had 30% more porcelain than they knew they had. We actually discovered we had a lot more. I'm looking at Jess, our curatorial assistant for the project. We discovered we had a lot more porcelain in our collection too, because once we, wow, actually, you know, had a curatorial fellow working at and starting to dig in that things were actually not reported in the same way, which also shows because our collection came in in the 50s and 60s and most of it had never been shown. Yeah. So what doesn't get shown doesn't necessarily get the, the same kind of attention. Yeah. And I'll say something else here. Um, there was also a absolute prescription against showing dinnerware. If anything was shown, it would only be figures. So the, but they had all this beautiful dinnerware and I felt again, like, why can't we see that as amazing? Like to me, I just put that saucer up there above those soldiers who are about to try to break through and our miners, I guess. I know. So it's like, this is good as an Agnes Martin painting. You know, this thing is amazing and it just has to be shown and dealt with and touched and thought about in a different way. So, um, so I insisted when I was at the factory, most of the things I made had some part of the dinnerware because also in the factory, the dinnerware was separated from the sculpture and they were shocked as, as, that I as a sculptor would want to use the dinnerware forms and, you know, maybe people disagree with me, but I think, you know, a tea cup is as good as any, you know, fantastic sculpture. If it's presented correctly. So now we're here. We're here. Thank goodness we got here. Uh, so this wonderful gallery that I was presented with is in part wonderful because it's glass and it is permeable to the outside and the outside is this La Corbusier building that I love. So these, these cuts in the wall are partially my homage to that building. So they are actually follow that shape of those cuts of, of those cubbies and we were able to figure out that, I mean, you know, Lynette and the team have been amazing saying, yes, okay, you can cut into the wall and yes, we'll make these things and yes, we'll light them and, you know, it is just one step at a time. So glad we lit them. I'm so glad we lit them. Yeah, I was saying, oh, you don't have to lit one, one step at a time. I knew you would do the right thing. So, uh, so here we are in the pre-game, uh, you know, setting things up and here again, this is what my reference is and not only am I referencing these, um, repeated box forms in the, in the building and the, um, I am also using concrete. That was why I chose to use the concrete as pedestal, um, and means of presentation. And I should say, if you didn't pay attention to the pedestals when you were in the installation, go back up and pay attention to the pedestals because it actually really was transformative and, and when you first approached me and said, you know, actually I, I think they all need to be made of concrete, task concrete, task concrete, um, and it was absolutely, it was absolutely right. So, there's a lot of discussion about that. So, cast concrete is another thing that one makes by pouring. So there's a, a met the methodology overlaps beautifully with the casting of porcelain. And it shows in the way the material is, um, you know, fluid, but still. Here we are at the Frick where, um, I was the first, uh, contemporary artist to do an installation and, uh, tried to figure out how to show their collection of, uh, Henry Arnholtz vast holdings. And then this is back, these are plates. This is my various things I've done with plates. So this is back at the RISD Museum and in this, you can see I did, I, I use the display, um, those half of the wall, it, it's actually, it was opposite side to the whole thing was as if I was envisioning this whole huge gallery as if it was a mold coming apart. And so those are in the negative. Can you see the shelf underneath? I made in the negative and these are in the positive. And that's ours. Yeah. And so in this doing, doing this installation, the gift of this glass room was also a challenge in terms of how to display things, um, because there weren't walls we could attach to, but also that we wanted to figure out how to address the passers-by from outside and not just from inside. And we are very happy to know that there is lots of nose, nose prints and finger marks on. I tried to take a picture for, for our lean of all of the nose and fingerprints on the glass outside the building, you know, because I said, see it's, it's working. And even when you were installing, oh yeah, it's true. You're getting with your team, you know, people, we get a lot of dog walkers, a lot of people coming by that way or down the ramp from the Carpenter's Center. And, you know, I said, wow, it's, it's already working and we're not even finished yet. So, so in devising this, um, armature, the idea was that when we actually, that we had to come up with a method two years ago to do this again during the pandemic, but one of the things that I've learned about installing is the magic always happens at the last minute. You can plan something, but it's not really, it's going to be good, but, you know, it always has to have some other tweaks at the last minute in order to be great. And so, um, so I designed this whole armature so that all of these things can move and change, uh, so that instead of it holding still, it, they could rotate in various ways and face different directions. Because again, I'm interested in the backs is what, you know, all, all, and I want people to feel how the thing is alive, not just dead. And it really was, you know, as, as, um, you started turning and tweaking the plates, you know, the whole constellation, you know, really literally, I mean, I think there were some gasps from the team. You know, as it started because it was like, oh, actually, we were moving away again from that sort of flat, you know, um, approach to, you know, oh, this is a plate and this is a cup, you know, it was, it was literally became a sculpture. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, and, and again, privileging the backs, the saw it, you know, not, not getting hung up like this is what you must look at, but all of it is interesting. And, uh, this is from the ICA, the catalog, this is the room, um, that we designed for the, the within my ICA show, there was a porcelain room. Uh, and they were so generous as to make this crazy room, which was amazing. That's pretty good. Yeah. Uh, inside my, you know, 20 year survey was the, the, this negative surprise. Uh, and, uh, with, you know, uh, I guess humor is something that I, um, find essential in my own, in whatever I am doing. Um, and is a language that reaches people, uh, and a way to make things, um, feel like, feel like they're alive. Uh, so I always use that now here. This is a good example. Uh, so this is the monkey band that, uh, which is a complicated thing that if you want to talk about it, Lynette, you know, we don't have, we don't have, we don't have to talk about it. But it's this prized 18th century thing, uh, of many figures, you know, in making music together. Uh, but this is how it is displayed at the RISC Museum originally. And then, whoop, sorry. And then I, like, let, like, made a whole crazy thing with, uh, you know, breaking it out so that they could actually have a party. Ha, ha, ha. Uh, this is at the Frick where I was interested in, like, placing things, like in Harvard, where we're, it's in the window and it's high up. It's everything. I think we think if it's not at eye level and we're, cause we're trained to just look at paintings, uh, if it's not at eye level at 54 inches, maybe we're not 61. Oh, 61. Yeah, whatever. That is not happening. And so I, uh, obviously don't believe that. So I think the way we stretch our bodies to look at things up and down is important and that there's a lot of delight in discovery, which is an 18th century Rococo idea to begin with. Uh, delight in discovery was one, one of the things that people would say, uh, they wanted. And I think we still want that. And watching, watching visitors interact with your installation, it really is. I mean, sort of crouching down or we had a whole discussion before, um, the conversation tonight about the slipper, which will do have a slide of, but, you know, it, it tunes you in, uh, and, and often, you know, literally makes you laugh, uh, out loud. Yeah. And reflection, also being an idea about mold. Uh, but at the frick, I, I hung, um, things. They had these cases that I would, I, I called like IBM cases, uh, and yet the museum is a beautiful house museum. So I said, no, we got to change this thing. I think when they asked me to do that, this project, they thought I was going to just pick out some, some of Henry's, porcelain and put it in those cases. That is exactly what they thought I was going to do. And when, that's what we thought, I'm just thinking. When I refused to do that, I said, you have a house museum, you need, you need brocade, you need furniture, you need to show things. So that, the porcelain room becomes the part of the house. And that's what was so nice as, as you were choosing these slides to to point to the kind of site specificity of your installation practice. So it was, you know, really, I mean, the Le Corbusier building, you know, the, the fact that it was our light filled rents of piano gallery, these mattered to the way that you thought about our, our installation. Yeah. There is another one of the sculptor gardens, the glaze. Outdoor, I got, I got the frick to let me put something outside in their garden. And that was, I remember you saying, oh, the connection to nature, the connection to being, you know, to having the inside and the outside really come together in the gallery. And something you mentioned yesterday was the significance of permeability. Yeah. And I thought that actually was something that resonated for me also in your, your own work in, in interesting ways. Permability. Yeah. How do you see that? Well, I think also in terms of how we've talked about the process. And if we think about even the sculptural body or the, maybe it's not permeability as much as malleability. Yeah. Well, that overlaps. Yeah. Yeah. And also that in doing it, I realized that that spot in the museum is also a place where one would enjoy really city. So we made a bench to go as part of the installation. And we've noted how successful it is. Yes. Yeah. This is why I was in the factory. This was taken. So this is called Gangsta Girl on the Block. So, you know, playing with a kind of hip hop culture in this while I was in Germany. And this very, very different mindset, you know, was really fun. But you can see I was using all these textile patterns from the 18th century. There was only one person in the factory who knew how to paint those. I did not paint those with a single brush, but I sat there with her. I drew them out and she painted it. There's no way I could do that. But the, the, the hybridity of, of what was happening there, of bringing in all kinds of patterns in one small figure was something that was interesting to me. And could you actually talk a little bit about these blocks? Oh, yeah. Because they also figure in the installation. And it's actually a question I've already had many times in the installation. So, these blocks, so Gangsta Girl on the Block, but these blocks, you might have, we had it, we should have put it again at the end. I had it in the factory. So during, you know, after one of my, after being there for about a year and digging into every corner of the factory, I opened some door and I realized, wow, I've never been in here. And there was just shelves and shelves of blocks like that. And turns out, so ceramics, not just porcelain, but all ceramics is an amazing recyclable material. The original recyclable material. And so when something is made and not fired, it can be, water can be added and can be slaked down and something else could be made from it. So those things were sl, this is the byproduct of those things being slaked down and then put through an extruder that had this form. And then they would let them dry and fire them. And this is, and then you grind them up, grind these things up to be used as aggregate within the porcelain body for, so that the porcelain would shrink or crack a little bit less because the shrinkage of this porcelain is 18%. So everything that one makes has shrunken down. I mean, it's hard, it's hard stopping. You know, my, in my, the ceramics that I work with now is 10%, but the 18% is just like it's transformed into something else. But because it has this aggregate, it probably is 18% and not 19 or 20%. And so the, the, the sort of holes in these blocks are just there to help it dry faster. Dry faster and fire easier. Not explode. It was solid. It would explode in under the heat. Yeah. But I love those things because there, there it is, the modernist grid, you know, and yet industrial. And it breaks. I have a long history of working with bricks. So it was just perfect. So the juxtapose, you know, being able to juxtapose these amazing figures and with things that I made has been just delightful and wonderful you know, to put it all together. Yeah. Sexy baby eyes over there. A fan favorite. That's because I was, I was just joking around when I made that and there was one woman at the factory would always like make paint these really come hither eyes. I was like, what is going on with these? And so I painted one eye and I was like, can you get in there and paint? I think one eye and she, yeah, she, she doctored mine. I see. I can never do this well. This is one of my favorite moments. Well, there is a slipper. So in, and that is actually those bricks. That's the same thing. That's those bricks. But then when I got to be friends with the guy and with the extruder, I was like, well, do you really have to cut them all like that? Can we cut some, you know, can we not cut some? Can you let me cut some? So that's that. I mean, I love this story, Arlene, because so much of it literally is about your building relationships. Yeah. The workers at the factory and you know, you, you call, you know, the works like casserole or some, a celebration of the worker, but actually the way you describe them and your collaborations with them, even though, you know, many of them did not speak any English. And you didn't really not speak German. So, so what was it? The language, the language of course, one. I mean, what, how did you actually communicate? Well, would I realize, at the end of some days, I would realize, oh, I haven't really talked to anybody. We would say, choose to then, you know, but the, I, I think the language of making is universal. So we could communicate through making or painting or, you know, laugh at one another's things. And there was also a lot of sugar passed around. They had a lot of, a lot of celebrations with cakes. So, you know, it was it was a pretty good environment. And one at the beginning of every day, we had the official good morning colleague, Hanshake, Eastern Germany, Hanshake. Yeah. So it was, it was a, a not to be missed experience. You're going to talk. I'm going to talk about this. Yeah. Well, so I mean, basically this is, this is the work in the installation that is not made of porcelain. And actually, a work that I fell in love with watching Arlene on Instagram live because it was the lockdown. And you had just opened your show at pace called Scurts with a really recent sculpture just made in in 2020. And I was watching Arlene after not having access to her exhibition for three months due to the pandemic. Reenter her, her gallery exhibition and see, see your work again after, you know, we were all in that face going to have what it was going to happen. And where, where things were going to take us. And I was also new to Instagram. So it was a special time. Watched you talk about this work, which is called Grammar. And really kind of spoke to me in the sense that I actually thought that was that was the moment where I knew this needed to be a work in the installation. And in some ways, you know, we'd had for many, many years Renee Sintonis's Daphne bronze was on this kind of center sideline to that gallery. And I sort of already started to imagine what would it be like to have Grammar this work of this clay body that you've also fired multiple times that had also this male ability, this relationship to the pores. And to me, it is almost like this pulsating organ. A top, again, this very, you know, strict steel. Yes. What do we have in what other ones we have? Oh, yeah, that show the neck. Yeah. So that's the underside of the wood. And I think that's what you would. I was thinking about expressionism and color, symbolism and, you know, studies of color. And, you know, as you enter into the gallery, you literally walk by France Mark's raising horses of four, which is a testament to really sort of pushing color and color combinations in painting. Yes. But you were inspired by a different artist altogether for, well, I was inspired for the bottom, but my seamless inspiration comes from all that German expressionist sculpture and those paintings. So that I felt was that the body, the heaviness of it, the glaze, all of those things I really felt spoke to the gallery before. So again, like Corbusier's over there and those great, that great, great collection of German paintings is on the other side. So being sandwiched in that is just divine. And the bottom, this wood form that this thing is birthing or the other way around is comes from Thomas Coles 19th century color wheel. So that is if you go underneath and look at it. Now, after yesterday, I had a memory of how in that video, I said something about delight and discovery because I'm hiding that color wheel underneath. And so I think that you're something you said resonated. I remember because we need this at the Harvard Art Museums. Yeah. And grammar, I had been reading something of Rosalind Krauss and now I can't remember what it was, but in there was the word grammar and I was like, that's that that's that primal primary idea of what everything comes from and and floods out to be there is an essentialism in in that. So and the elemental in the in the color wheel and then you know, as you literally take it up the sides and it becomes this kind of you know, rising spectrum of color. And what I loved also is that in the exhibition skirts, you know, thinking about this also as a skirt like form sort of feminine form and we had our peckstein window, would you integrate it into the installation and that I think you learned to to embrace. Yes. But that you know, again, was also this female figure. Yeah. And it's completely different our tradition of of decorative arts making. So yeah. Well, it's you know, for me, it's really as the fulcrum of of this gallery and has been great to see actually people, you know, there isn't anyone who comes into the gallery who doesn't at some point walk all the way around grammar. Yeah, we were very careful to place it so that it could be walked all the way around. That's just a wonder what it probably looks like out there right now. No. And we are very happy very pleased with ourselves during the installation. So yeah, I would actually love in the time that that remains to open it up for questions, comments for lean about anything. Philip? Oh, here's a microphone. Philip, just a sec. Okay. I'm discovering your work through, you know, this this this show and did you work a lot with porcelain and ceramic before? And are you are you continuing afterwards? I did not I had never worked with porcelain. And I'm not working. I'm spoiled. I'm working with actually, I guess I'm making some drawings that are using porcelain slabs, but but not in a sculptural form. So I have to working at the factory, but I had been working with ceramics and I'm still using ceramics, but not as my only material. That's why grammar is a great example. Yeah, actually because it's integrating so many different materials that that you turn to really repeatedly. Yeah, yeah, there's always an equation of some wood, some steel, sometimes more, you know, some clay. He's asking if, oh, would I go back to my son? You're doing it with a bit of my son. It was more PTSD. So more not that I didn't love it, but the thing was I didn't know anybody in that town. I lived a very solitary life there and I literally would walk. So I worked all the time. I worked because I didn't have anything else to do. So I worked 16 hours a day very, very regularly and everybody would leave the factory at three and I would be alone in the factory. And that I mean, I taught myself not to be terrified. So I managed to do it, but you know, and then walk home by myself through this whole town. So I don't think I would be as extreme. I was just trying to learn everything I could and do everything that was possible. And so when I was very hard for me to stop, but I would be interested possibly to go to a different factory and see and compare methods, methodologies. And see if they would give me access. But a lot of the other porcelain factories want me to do. I have been invited to places, but they want me to do something that is a multiple that they can sell. And you know, I could stay home and make my own work. And so I want to do that. Well, maybe we would explain why there's so much work from that period in porcelain. Yeah, yeah, it's true. I always just shocked actually at how much just about two years. I commuted. I mean, I did come back. I would have gone truly out of my mind. And people visited me. But when they visited me, except for my husband, they were never allowed into the factory. Even the curators who visited that I knew from Christen. I was really, it was really, so people were calling me up all the time. Like, oh, good, you're there. Can I get in? That's why I took the tourist tour. Yeah, yeah, I know we'll have to go back. I think they would let me go in now because I've seen anything. But and I love, you know, there's been over the years, will that factory continue? Will, you know, I and I certainly hope that that it will. Because and I was actually even asked to buy this state. People from this state, you know, it's just like, yeah, there are people there who know things that nobody else knows. You have to keep it going. Because it's a continuous production since 1710. So it just doesn't exist. And something that you've pointed out before that it's really multi-generational workers there. So who are from my son, you know, kind of, you know, their parents and their grandparents. I mean, so there is a knowledge you mentioned, the woman who was the only one who could actually knew that it still paint some of those designs. Yeah, yeah. I mean, there's complications. There are socio-political complications to having a factory town, which is essentially what it is. Because people don't have other means of employment. And then they're very intensely trained to do this thing. So what else can they do and where else can they go? So I spent a lot of time trying to get people to learn to speak English. I mean, because really that was there to get it, that was there to get it out into some other place if they wanted to be. But there's a lot of resistance. Okay. I think Christians, oh, he has one up there, Francesca. Hi, thank you so much. This was fascinating. And I love what you've done. I was curious about your the act of curating, you know, of mixing your own work with the collections and whether this is something that, you know, what you've learned from that, what we may have learned from that, and what, you know, how you made some of the decisions that you did, whether it's, you know, stacking little, you know, placing the little slipper there and that figure, is it just, I don't know, kind of your sense of whimsy and humor. But then there's also the whole very sculptural complex installation of the plates that required a lot of assistance. I know from our exhibitions department and what, you know, what role did you have and also the design of that. And, yeah, I guess just how you navigate all of those choices with a team of other people too. Yeah. And is that translated into other projects that you work on? Yeah. Well, number one, I'm a sculptor. So I'm dealing with space and questions of space and placement all of the time in my work. So none of it is really that foreign to me. It's what I love to do. Play in different spaces. And then I think I also feel that there's a special privilege one gets as an artist. I don't, to break out of an art historical format that maybe you're, I'm worried. I definitely would have been allowed to build this plate constellation, no. Yeah. So I, so, so I feel like I get to play in this field. I just did a show at the drawing centers. That was just somebody's drawing collection. And I got to play with those things too. And so it wasn't spatial in the three-dimensional sense as much, although I did bring in three dimensions. But I just feel like it's my natural. It's what I do. It's what I do best. I've always, I toyed with being an architect. You know, I, I think there's architecture within sculpture and sculpture within architecture. So it's all the same thing. My work, when I was starting to make ceramics, I was building, I built bases or pedestals for those pieces. And people were constantly talking about that. Oh, you're building it. And for me, the, the, that, that just, I couldn't understand why that was special. It seemed natural that one would need to think about the whole. And in fact, I think the whole incorporates the gallery. It incorporates that whole, that museum, the space. The, and then maybe outside and then maybe inside. And then maybe audience. So I feel we break things down in our lives in ways that I just have the privilege as an artist working within a museum structure that I don't have to accept. And so it is a delight and a privilege. And I get to work with professionals and amazing historical objects that I don't have access to regularly. That I get to touch with my installation, if not with my hand, but often with my hand. Well, that was the great moment actually after the week. We couldn't actually have you here. When you finally were able to come last September and we had all of the porcelain up in the art study center on, on the level four. And Arlene, you finally start, you know, literally moving things around. We saw some of those images. And I have to say it was a very exciting moment for me. And I think for the whole team because we were like, Oh, now it's really happening. Yeah, it can't really happen until it's until it's you're in the space with things. But I love, I love doing installation. And I think all of my shows are done with that same consciousness. When it's only my own, when it's my own work as well. Hello, I also have another question. And I want to first like say thank you and I absolutely adore your piece and like your art concept. And I have a question like how do you choose the material for the installation or like for display your pieces? Because I know you'll use a lot of different materials like cock cree or like wood. How do you understand the relationship between like those material and ceramics or like porcelain? You mean when I'm installing in an institution or when I'm just making my own? Or even like in the show like how do you choose the material like why you put your like porcelain works on the concrete like like porc like porc concrete or like it? Well, the port concrete came from trying to reference the the building, the corpusier building that was concrete building. A cast concrete building which is a very sort of a radical building well known icon of modern architecture. So I was wanting to honor that and so that's my nod to that. So there's usually I privilege just making the decision without overthinking it. And that is something that is also when one is making art. There's a lot a decision a minute. So I'm a good decision maker. I can attest to that. I can attest to that. Well thank you so much Arlene. This was wonderful. Thank you for coming. Thank you all for coming tonight and I just wanted to remind you that actually Arlene's installation and also all of our modern and contemporary galleries on level one are open until nine o'clock. So if you'd like to go back up and take another close look or take a look at our collections now is your chance. And I do want to put in a plug for our Bush Risinger Museum Instagram where we have a lot of conversations about rethinking our historic collections and around art and identity and you can find us at Bush underscore hall. So follow us. Arlene follows us very actively. So I'm thank you for that. And yeah thank you all for coming and see you at our next event. Check out the calendar for what's coming up next at the Harvard Art Museums.",

I am the Henderson Curatorial Fellow in East Asian Art at Harvard Art Museums. In December 2021, the East Asian Art garris at Harvard Art Museums reopened to the public. The current rotation in Chinese and Korean garris is picturing lives of women, which highlights female subjects as well as female artists and female donors. Cooculated with Sarah Rosen, our Curator of Chinese Art, I am excited to see this time the rotation of our permanent collection, spotlights traditional female weaving in broadery and sewing. A topic certainly deserves more attention at museums. Today, in this art talk, we are going to explore works related to an Asian Chinese lady. This lady, her name is Su Hui. Su Hui is famed for her talents in poetry and weaving. At our museums, we have three paintings related to Su Hui. Two of them are displayed at the current rotation. This is an image of Su Hui. Lady Su Hui was supposed to have lived in the late fourth century. Paintings of Su Hui were recorded as early as in the eighth century. However, these paintings no longer exist. The painting you see here was painted around the 18th century with the colored red and archaic figure of style. Next to Su Hui's portrait, it is an image resembling Su Hui's famous blockade of pelendromic poems. It is said that the piece of blockade used five colored silks. It is about eight inch long and eight inch wide. Lady Su Hui wore 840 characters and more than 200 poems on this blockade. The poems are pelendromic poems, which can be read vertically or horizontally, in reverse, diagonally, in a circle or even every other character. The blockade of pelendromic poems was made for her husband, Dotao. Dotao is an official who spent a notable amount of time away from his wife. During his absence, Lady Su Hui missed him and wrote a petty poem and finally wore these poems into a piece of blockade. It had the blockade sent to him. Su Hui's pelendromic poems have been admired by Chinese scholars through centuries. By contrast, her weaving talent is less mentioned. It is probably because weaving was traditionally considered as a domestic labor rather than an art form. Nevertheless, based on literature and historical records, Su Hui created an amazing piece of art work. Although her work no longer exists, the complexity of weaving technique is Su Hui's work, can't be revealed through an existing heart blockade. This is the heart blockade. It is an art protector. The piece is an early sample of blockade with Chinese characters, which reads five stars rise in the east. The heart blockade was created close to Su Hui's time. The size of heart blockade is also close to Su Hui's work. It is discovered in an archaeological excavation at the Yiyah Sikjiang province. In 2015, researchers of Chinese silk museum started to make a replicator of five star rise in the east, with a pattern, blue, that recreated out the base of remains found in the heart tube 2000 years ago. Here we see the border reconstruction of the heart blockade. Added border reconstruction of heart pattern blue. In the end, it took a year to complete the replicator. So we can imagine that the lady Su Hui probably deliberately worked on a love period time to weave the blockade of palatomic points. In Su Hui's case, the activity of weaving is of course not just to make textile, but also to weave it with her love, affection, and desire. Su Hui's story has become a part of the source for painting. Such as the one shown here, it is a long head squirrel of painting contained four parts of depiction. This is the most popular narrative for that to paint Su Hui's story in late in period China. From right to left, the narrative begins with Su Hui weaving poems on a piece of blockade. Su Hui said the blockade to her husband, Dotao. Dotao reading poems on the blockade. Added Dotao returning home to bring Su Hui away with him. In our Harvard Art Museums, we have a later copy of this painting. The first section of this painting is displayed in our current rotation. It shows here. It shows a group of ladies are busy in preparing silk and weaving. A lady dressed in red is supposedly the lady Su Hui. She is sitting at the loop called Stray Hado Panty Blue. This is a jaw loop, furnished with a figure tower of the up level. Su Hui here. Many textile historians believe this type of loop existed as early as 100 times about 2000 years ago, and was widely used in the town and the silk times from sevens to 13th century. In the courtyard, we see gold servants and cockulbines are busy in preparing silk. This scene as the subscribers have pointed out is a combination of images from different paintings, such as pictures of the tiled and of the weaving and the paintings of palace pleasures. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see how Su Hui's stories are used here to add romantic passion to the female work of weaving. In later in the period of China, ladies Su Hui is one of the representative women in the new genre of Chinese beauty. For example, Su Hui's image is included in a long-haired scroll of painting that creates around the 18th century. The painting contains 56 beauties. They are quote ladies, cockulbines, quotisians, and even dance. The 56 beauties are not only beautiful, talented, but importantly, they bravely embrace the love, romance, and affection. The image of 56 beauties is a clear departure from a crucial idea of women, inferior, passive, and obedient. Here we see Su Hui dress in a 17th century female fashion, city, and allure. Out of the right, upper right, corner of the e-veager, there is a point dedicated to Su Hui. It reads, spree silk woven into a blockade of pelotropic poems, pig tears, liqueurine, and uncovered at the cold well, said by love using small characters to people far away. Here, by the way, with the poem, a vivid image of a lady Su Hui appears. Beautiful, talented, but alone. Clearly, the simplified rule pictured in the painting is a sick bow for Su Hui's weaving devotion and her romantic passion for love. If you are interested in Su Hui's story, then you will certainly enjoy many other fascinating stories where you visit our rotation. I hope you will enjoy our rotation and we look forward to seeing you there soon. Thank you.",
18,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:813157?width=3000&height=3000,Untitled Broken Crowd,Rashid Johnson,2023,"Hello everybody. Thank you all so much for coming out to our virtual tour, the first one of 2022, in fact. So today's tour represented in the celebration of Black History Month will take a look at two new works of art by renowned black artists that are currently on view at the Harvard Museums. So both artists, Candid Riley and Micheal Johnson were born in 1977 and the works were produced only a year apart in 2020 and 2020 on the spectrum, which I think is quite interesting. So together we're going to explore how these two artists treat faces, faces, material and much more. Fantastic. So before we jump right into the art brief introduction, my name is Cecilia. I am a junior at Harvard, double majoring in art history and English literature. I am originally from Ottawa, Canada, but while I'm at Harvard, I am a proud resident of Quincy House. Yes, and I am Philip. I am a current junior studying mathematics at the college. I am from Evanston, Illinois, and I'm a resident of Dunstrow House. So here is the beautiful light filled call the wood courtyard, which is what you see first upon entering the Harvard Art Museums. And here we'll give you just some quick words to let you know what you can expect for the format of this evening's tour before we get into things. So usually the student guide towards feature selection of three works, one from each of the three collections that together make up the Harvard Art Museums. Today, of course, we're going to be focusing on two one from Kindle Wiley and the other from Rashid Johnson. And each of the tours is independently designed and researched by the guides who give it. So if you attend our colleagues tours in the future, which we very much hope you will, you'll see that each of the tours is unique. So our tours are also very interactive. So as we talk through the works today, we'll be asking you questions and writing a participation. And we hope you will participate by typing your responses in the chat box below and feel free to pop any questions you have in this chat box. And we will try to get some of the students possible. But if we don't manage to do so, we will be a dedicated Q&A period at the end of the course. Well, so do not worry. Most of your residents will be answered in some capacity. Yeah, wonderful. And with that, let's jump right in. So we are beginning our tour tonight with Kindle Wiley's painting, which is located in one of the first floor galleries. And here are some installation shots so you can get a sense of what it looks like in the gallery. It's really, really fantastic work that I hope all of you will be able to see in person. And here is a better look at the work itself with a picture of me beside it in the top right so you can get a sense of its scale. I'm five four in case that is helpful. But before I tell you anything else about this painting, I'd like to get our eyes warmed up for this evening. So I'll turn it over to you all in the audience and ask you what you notice about this work. What are we looking at, you know, what do you see? What intrigues you. No observation is too small or too seemingly obvious to be noted. We're going to start from from the ground up with this. So we're looking at our eyes warmed up again. Flowers. Yeah, fantastic. So this is one of what I think is is one of the most wonderful and exciting beautiful things about this painting is flowers, the field of flowers, as someone has also said. These figures are set against an incredible floral florid background. And this, this background. I mean, again, I wish you could see it in person. It is so luminous. I mean, when you enter the gallery, it is as though this painting is itself the light source of the gallery. It almost makes the other works look kind of dull or dim in comparison. Some of the remarks that they're fascinated by the four pairs of eyes. Oh, interesting. So there are three figures in the work, but you, oh, oh, the figure or the face on the shirt. That's a really great observation that I hadn't occurred to me before. But yeah, there's these very kind of arresting eyes, particularly the figure, the rightmost figure, the kind of girl who's standing with her hip or with her hand on her hip. She has kind of those those proverbial eyes that follow you around the room body language, all looking in different directions. Yeah, absolutely. Again, back on the eyes and the body language, the these figures have a real kind of presence about them. The oval frame is an interesting choice. Yes, indeed. It's also again in the gallery, you would notice that, you know, I mean, obviously many the vast majority of paintings are rectangular either, you know, portrait or landscapes. That's what his two terms come from. And yet the oval the oval frame, the oval canvas is very striking and very kind of arresting and kind of curious to look at. So fantastic. Here is a better look at the figures in the portrait. So I'm going to tie up some of the threads that you all identified, give you a little bit more context about this work and to him, the wily who painted it. So, of course, this is a very recent painting by and the wily which over to the slides so you can see the the tombstone information painted in 2020 and as the title suggests, it is a portrait of Asia's money, Gabriella S may and Kaya Palmer, Kaya being the mother of the two girls on either side of her in this painting. And wily in case you didn't know is the artist who painted Barack Obama's recent portrait and his practice very much revolves around the grand tradition of portraiture. His citter is who are invariably black people dressed in kind of every day clothing street clothing, nothing terribly special. And he has them pose in postures and poses drawn from the history of art. And I think before I cut out, I think I saw someone ask if it was the case that kind of wily hide sperm in the background of all of his paintings and it's interesting that you asked. So I believe what you might be referencing is a previous or like a bit of an earlier body of work in which he did paint sperm all over the background of his very floored paintings. But most of his work, he's especially known for considering constructions of black masculinity painting black men in again, various poses drawn from the history of art. This particular the this particular body of work that is the series from which this portrait comes deals more specifically with black femininity, all of the citters painted throughout the series of his painting comes from our women. And so this painting and I would imagine the others do not do not have sperm tucked into the background. But yeah, to again, to reiterate on some of the things I was saying before, you know, these figures are not to distinguish military leaders or aristocrats or even celebrities like Barack Obama, but regular people, these that are in particular, he pulled from the streets of East London. And if you could skip ahead to the next slide. So turning our attention away from the figures from a moment, I want to pick back pick up back on the question of the background, which a lot of people kind of initially jumped on this very striking floral background. So let's start to think more closely about what it is populates the ground of this painting. So what again, do you all notice about the background. What's your first impression of it? Do you like it? What mood does it evoke? I've actually heard a surprisingly wide range of responses to this mood question. So I, I'm very curious. I've heard quite quite disparate answers. And I have my own thoughts, but I'm very curious about what you all think. We're all very struck by the by the flowers at first. So yellow is a wonderful color. Yeah, I agree. Yellow is I think my second favorite color. And again, I think it works in this painting to such a striking effect. Again, this is an incredibly luminous painting. And perhaps you can tell us much from from the digital reproduction, but again in the galleries. I mean, it looks like it is itself a light source. William Morris. Wow, very astute as a fill up with saying very good observation. We will pick up on that in just a moment. The figures are almost dissolved by the flowers. Yes, absolutely. So very interestingly, the background doesn't remain the background, right. These tendrils, these these branches, these stems and blooms kind of emerge from behind the figures and kind of populate the space in front of them. They cover them to some degree or kind of wrap around the flowers, ground them, but also put them in the air. Absolutely. So yeah, in this in this close up of the little girls shoe, for instance, we can kind of see how there's this interesting kind of weightlessness, right. We might be a little bit curious about what the relationship between the figures and the flowers is. She looks like she's kind of tucked in behind them. But then again, there's it's not like that she's crushing them or anything like that. There's this interesting, yeah, weightless kind of floating nature about them. It looks all consuming is if there's no negative space. Yeah, absolutely. This is a very kind of busy densely packed background. And if you could go to the next slide. So someone mentioned earlier, William Morris, absolutely. So this wallpaper comes from a particular wallpaper design by the 19th century artist poet and polymath William Morris. Now William Morris was a leading figure in the arts and crafts movement, which opposed the industrialism of the Victorian age. Oh Philip, do what you mind skipping through the next slide. Thank you. Sorry, one one back. Oh, there we go. Yeah, sorry. I think something was wishing on my end, lagging. Yeah, so the arts and crafts movement really espoused a craft attitude towards artistic production. The Morris and his cohort were really interested in a kind of from scratch attitude. Again, opposing the kind of industrialism that defined their time period and really wanting to get back to kind of from scratch craft techniques. And the Morris, Morris enjoyed enormous success as a wallpaper and textile designer among his other pursuits. And the quote that you see on this on this slide is really paradigmatic of his approach. And again, the pattern in the background of this painting comes from a specific pattern called Compton, which you can see on the left is actually still in production today. Originally, it was first produced in 1896 for the large rooms of an English state. And of course, Wiley has changed around the color palette, but you may notice that he is huge pretty closely to the original pattern, reproducing it almost exactly. So all this densely packed floral business comes not strictly from Wiley himself, but from William Morris working at the end of the 19th century. And I think it's especially interesting to go to the next slide is that Wiley has captured not only the pattern of the wallpaper, but also the medium of the original paper. So the 19th century wallpaper would have been executed in block print. So closely, you might notice that the way it's painted in Wiley's work, the way that the flowers are painted, why this work really minimizes any sense of the artists hand, it really does look printed. And between the and you might notice the the figures in contrast look very photographic. They look highly naturalistic again, almost photorealistic. And so between these two polls, this apparently printed background and the photograph like depiction of the figures themselves. This painting all seems to camouflage the circumstances of its own creation. It's a it's a painting that gestures to these all these other artistic media, none of which are painting. But there is one more important point of reference and some of you may have already made the connection from the title of the series. I'm not sure if you caught this before I cut out actually, but this the series that this work comes from is called the yellow wallpaper and app to name perhaps given the background that that so defines the quality of this work. Next slide, please. The name the yellow wallpaper references a feminist short story of the same title, which was written by Charlotte Parkton, skillman and published in 1892, just four years before this wallpaper pattern was first produced by William Morris. And the story is a landmark of early feminist literature, it describes the plight of a woman who has been unwillingly kept at home on and involuntary rest cure to cure an alleged case of hysteria. And the woman describes in detail this awful, horrid yellow wallpaper that covers the walls of the nursery in which she spends most of her time. And you can see an excerpt of her description on the slide before you. So she becomes increasingly obsessed with this wallpaper and eventually hallucinates that there is a woman trapped behind it. The story culminates in this first person narrator, this woman essentially imagining that she is the woman behind the wallpaper and it ends in this very surrealistic and unnerving ending. And so the wallpaper becomes a figure of her imprisonment, if you read the the short story, it becomes almost animate this this this kind of decrepit animal that that imprisons her again in the in the walls of her home. And the story again was was very important, it was again a kind of landmark of early feminist literature, and that was important for its discussion of attitudes towards women's mental and physical health at the time. So what we see in this painting is that Wiley has seized upon this moment in history, where two people, Morris and Gilman are both thinking very hard about the significance of design and duration and in particular wallpapers specifically, of course, to very different ends. Both individuals have set their sights on wallpaper as this uniquely fertile site of larger resonance and significance, Morris seeing it as seeing its kind of potential for bringing light beauty art into the home into the into one's domestic environment. And Perkins similarly kind of picking up on the sort of on the presence of something like wallpaper and thinking of it instead as a kind of figure for imprisonment or something that has that that can have this kind of large that can bear this larger cultural significance that can capture the sightseist of its time. So implicit within both of these creators understandings of wallpaper of design of decoration is that in short, our surroundings matter that they're not nearly trivial issues of aesthetics, but the things that surround us can really have major importance on the way we live our lives and the way we experience the societies and the cultures that surround us. And while he folds all of that into this painting his work to indeed his entire practice is about what we see who we see or don't see around us. And so with that, I will wrap up my section of the of the tour again today we've looked at two artists who were born in the same year and who created these works only one year apart, widely in 2020 and Johnson, even more recently in 2021 to artists that are thinking very hard about the relationship between figure and ground that is the figure background between foreground and background sticking to that space. In very different ways, but both harnessing the power of the power that background that we're proud can bring to care. Okay, can everybody see I can always see John so okay perfect. All right, so I'll be presenting the sheet Johnson's work as mentioned before this was created in 2021 and you know what standards for any one of these tours and I think is a good exercise for you guys are even our privately. I want to ask you guys quickly what is it that you are seeing like when you're looking at this piece what stands out to you what do you remark more to your first impulses to like that. Okay very abstract yes, pairs of objects interesting crack service various dude looks like tiles okay paper collage time time was a right all very good it's so I want to come it says it's a very busy mosaic reminds you mid century modern art various to yes all these are. On point exactly what else color choices are muted interesting interesting shoes also very interesting yeah yeah yeah so i'm getting i'm getting notions of collective of mosaic of. You know faces yes okay very interesting john very interesting so oh yeah so. This is wonderful thank you this is a great start so we're seeing you know people saying shoes will saying faces you know collective muted colors tiles mosaics all this is true all this is true but she johnson is you know not only is he you know known for using a lot of materials and tiles in his work. But also fun fact he's from the same hometown that I'm from and you know this hometown is also the first place in the United States have operations so Evanson so. He sort of builds himself off of this sort of like conceptualization of repairing things sort of doing these sort of patchwork works in this lot of engineering and this will be more relevant later on the tour but yes on the topic of what it looks like this is indeed mosaic of some sort right. And so let's comment more someone did say faces and that is exactly correct and it helps even switch your eyes just a little bit. And then you can see that you know someone said a pair of objects and that that exactly to there are about you know 15 faces here on the screen and this is exactly what I'm saying the galleries you're getting a pretty one to one representation. Of course i'll show you later the scale so you can see just how immense this work is anything else anyone wants to say about you know the color disposition yes you said colors are muted but like what else are people feeling when they. First see this you know sort of first jumps for some pulses anything everything's great. One of the colors remind you of what sorts of yes Ross eyes and they're interesting interesting what sorts of services materials you guys see and i'll we'll dive into you know more focus. So I'll just just pieces later on get across embarrassing so now interesting sharp to grab geometric figures interesting yes yes. Aha various to yes disrupted by a diagonal attention is later since it's very pivotal for. Johnson's overall movement but at the same time yes yes that's various to okay so we're going to dive into a deeper inspection of the materials now so taking a look at these two photos i took these legally of course in the armies in the last week and. It's hard to tell admittedly when I first saw this I wasn't really sure I was looking at but what can you guys tell me about the specific materials like yes or a lot of tiles use but can you take any guesses jabs of other materials you might see views here on screen. For instance some of them might be there could be stone it could be class it could be mirrors any options any ideas really like you know what what's what it comes on clay okay good good good so not just start tiles yes some paint clay. Variety to materials use red lipstick interesting interesting. Okay any other ideas wax yes yes like crown smears exactly exactly shells yes various to various to you guys are really good at maybe my photos are good I don't know string also yeah so over variety materials were used for this it's like very athletic people were saying you know it reminds them too so there are a whole host a whole family even diverse materials used for these works i'll click over to the next slides we can see you know a different angle so here there are some tiles He has a trend of integrating burnt and then re-burnt and then branded wood. Someone mentioned wax. That's also true. It's hard to see here, but unadditions from painting lipstick is also, it's of like black soap, a variety of different materials, all very interesting, all melding together very well. Okay, here, even closer on two individual faces. Further impulses, what do you guys see? What about their expressions? Stand out to you. What's surprising? What's intriguing? Three-dimensional, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. So while this is a mosaic, in some ways, by adding some of the other materials, like the rocks, like the mirrors, the glass, it sort of adds another dimension to it. Right? Yeah. Found objects from this community. Interesting. I think in some respects, yes. I mean, he, you know, a lot of times he lives in his own workspace. Looks like they're crying a bit. Okay, very interesting. So then maybe the paint could give that idea of them, sort of coming to life a bit more. Right? The E-scene had different personalities, very interesting, very interesting. And feeling as something hidden from you are obscured. Wow. Okay. That is very precise, various dude. I'll jump away from this slide per second to go to the broad of view. So this is me next to the work in the galleries. I'm about six streets, on a good basics four. So you have a good idea like how how large this work is. The one that Rashid is standing on is not exactly the same one. It comes from a larger sort of movement that he has been bringing over the past couple years of the hikers. So this style with the sort of pixelated square rectangular faces, you know, quite common this obviously. And we'll dive into the later to the lore of his entire work. But yes, this is a series of mosaics that attempt to capture what Rashid wanted to sort of portray as in the notion of like anxiety, right? He first conceptualized these broken faces, the broken crowds, if you will. While in Germany when he tried to sort of find different methods of expressing himself or believing anxiety through yoga, through dance, and he came to this notion of, you know, being outside in hikers. And so that's exactly who we're seeing depicted here, right? And so yeah, we'll come to this symmetry a bit as somebody point out with a cross and the diagonal, all very if he ordered materials or went back and forth. So I can talk about that now, right? So he started off by first drawing the entire thing, right? A lot of this was first drawn and then he laid on materials and then placed them in different orders. So you know, sometimes he died paint, sometimes you have maximum, right? Something he burned them. It's a very intricate process. There's some really cool interviews on YouTube if you're interested in checking those out. We described some of his, you know, prior works where he made a lot of shelves and stuff like that. And so the materials we see here mainly consists of ceramic tiles, you know, mirrors, oyster shells, this one, you're very well-stuted, branded red oak, bronze, spray paint, oil, black soap wax. It's a whole host of materials and some of them have like a lot of significance. And so what is very subtle to see here is this sort of diagonal stroke. And what could that sort of mean? It's like we're looking at a mosaic with a lot of different pieces, all interacting in ones, a lot of materials, lots of different faces. But at the same time, they're brought together and there's a sort of slash in the middle, like what could what could that mean? Like why would she sort of interrupt the piece with this sun bag? Well, that's not reflected anywhere else in any symmetric manner. Like what do you guys just thoughts on that? Almost like a scar or a bandage? Yes, yes. That's one very, very good interpretation. It's, this is a variety of ways to interpret this. And so we're diving into a bit more of the background behind this series of broken faces. As I mentioned previously, but she Johnson wanted to communicate this idea of anxiety and how society deals with it, especially in the past year and a half. We've done do a lot of transmissions to society, whether that's novel reckoning on race or politics, or how we deal with the pandemics. It's a lot for us to carry. And so while individually, we might have our own experiences like each of the faces, each expressing their own different trauma, their own grief, we as a collective sort of depict our own sort of collective memory as well as our own individual memories. And as you see in this photo of a 20 19 exhibition in Mexico or in the next slide, or it's more of the drawings that the anxious men, we guys are really getting to understand what's sort of going on underneath the surface. And the main motivation, at least, if we're going to refer to any sort of interdestuality here, is referencing what's from the whole or from Tony Morrison. I talked a lot about the notion of being outside and being put outside, hence why, for she Johnson speaks of these hikers as a principle, figures in his works. For Morrison being put out and put outside her two different phenomena in which being put outside sort of implies that you're marginalized but unable to integrate and put out means that, yes, at the moment you're outside, you can find yourself back in at some point. And so I resonate with this a lot, being of underrepresented background, oftentimes you find yourself marginalized and you're able to just, for the moment, be put out and then find yourself being integrated. But there is a lot of anxiety on the surface that plays a big role. And the materials in this piece, and for a lot of this pieces, have immense significance. Since I don't know, there's a lot of important symbolism here. For instance, some of these materials are pretty mesothropic, at least in historical contexts, since the shells, especially oyster shells, were previously used as currency in the psychedrate or black soaps to have a larger symbolism of the commodification of Africa, African culture, its resources, the entire sort of black soaps field there of being commodified for a different purpose outside of itself. And in a weird way, Johnson brilliantly, you know, in combination with this notion of being put outside and the idea of movement, as communicated by the Ark and for Johnson, you know, he, in a lot of ways is sort of expressing the internal grief and internal survey that's contrasted by the outside notion of stability. Right? So on the one hand, we have this mosaic tiles. And tiles are very durable, right? Like if you go to, you know, mosaics from ancient Rome or subway stations to all made of tiles, those things are insanely durable, they'll be here long after we're gone. And then he layers on there very and very raw materials like black soap, wax, lipstick paint, things that, well, he mentioned they're not explicitly meant to do so, but that can be scratched off at some point. So for just generally, for the anxiety that we as a society suffer, yes, there are some things that are permanent. The scars internally as someone said previously that we suffer from trauma that are irreparable. However, what can be changed is our appearance and how we express ourselves as a collective, right? And how we move on is content for, you know, the general movement of society. And, and then this I really find the billions of his work, so that he combines all these elements together in some way that you would not expect and then the overall effect is, you know, quite surprising. We'd love to take any questions that you might have at this time. So feel free to, feel free to pop them in the chat box as you've been doing. Thank you Cecilia. Thank you, Philip. Excellent tour. Thank you everyone for joining us. We are a little bit over time, but I think that that is okay. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to put them in the chat and thoughts. Looks like we have one or two that are coming. Right someone said someone asks, could it be that black people, much like wallpaper, were off a taken as articles for the home? I think this is some definitely something that is weighing on Wiley's mind and absolutely something that he wants us to think about is. Of course, you know, the history of black people in America needless to say is an extraordinarily fraught one that begins with the kind of fundamental perversion of the legal distinction between persons and property. And so absolutely, and of course this legal perversion is something is one whose consequences we're still feeling very directly today. And so absolutely, I think in thinking about in taking something that is so strongly a marker of domesticity as wallpaper and Victorian wallpaper, especially, you know, something that we think of as something lodged in history, a sort of I at least had to think of everything to do with Victorian era as somewhat stuffy and again, as lodged in history. And and juxtaposing that with, you know, these these three black people, I think Wiley really is inviting us to think about, you know, issues of objectification, issues of entertainment or minstrelseeing, you know, there's there's a lot of when it comes to the realm of the aesthetic, I think there are a lot of really fraught operations that can take place. And that certainly have taken place in thinking about marginalized groups and the way that they can be treated as, you know, objects of entertainment, as decoration, and certainly as property. So absolutely, I think you've really picked up on this central tension that kind of underlies this work. And that serves, I think, as a foil to what I think is a rather triumphant depiction of these three figures. I mean, some of you remark in the beginning that they look really, I mean, they have striking kind of eye contact and very self-assured body language. I mean, they look noble. So yeah, I think there's a really important tension, in short. Can you comment on the brown vine that has entwined itself in the shoe, the girl on the right? Yeah, I mean, this is a great question. Actually, this is something that I've had a lot of conversations with people about how to parse the fact that these vines, these tendrils are kind of wrapping themselves around the figures. You know, should we read this in light of, for instance, the short story where there is a figure who kind of, or a character rather, who imagines her to be actually herself to be behind the wallpaper. And, you know, whether we should read this as empowerment or, I don't know, something a little bit more sinister, something about, you know, reading these flowers as trapping or holding these figures behind. Honestly, I'm not sure. I, you know, again, when you see this work in person, this is something that I've seen a couple of people comment on that I've talked to about this work when we visited it in the gallery. It's people find themselves immediately drawn to the shoes of the figures. Part of it, I think, is because it's, you know, a very large painting. The shoes are like kind of at eye level for, I love what they're about. But they're also hyper realistic, like the, the footer realistic quality of the figures, I think is most of these at the shoes and at the Nike logo and things like that, and the shine of the pattern platter. And that's where the contrast is strongest between the way that the figures are depicted and the way that the background that is the wallpapers depicted. And so, yeah, that was part of the reason I included that detail is people, the mics, at least, have been drawn immediately to that kind of passage. You know, I imagine that there must be some kind of rationale for having, having, you know, wrapped the vines around her shoes like that. I think this is a kind of motif that appears throughout Wiley's practice is, for instance, even if you look at the Obama portrait, there are kind of elements of the background that appears from the front of him. I think it has my, my sense, my speculation would be that it has something to do maybe with rootedness. I read it as, I read them as being rather empowered in this depiction rather than trapped or imprisoned by the flowers. And so I wonder if it has something to do with this idea of being rooted in history, newly rooted in history, as though Wiley is writing them into the canon of art history and into the canon of regular history, social history. But yeah, that would be my closest speculation. I apologize, it's not a perfectly satisfying answer. Okay, perfect. We're running up on time if anyone has any final thoughts, please feel free to put them in the chat. And while we are thinking about that, I will click in the chat that hope family student guide tours for the spring semester are going to be every Thursday with a clock. So next Thursday the 17th, maybe is going to present a theme staged. So please join us for that. I did see a comment about whether the talk would be posted, perhaps in the future. And it is being recorded, so hopefully it will, when it is, it will be on YouTube page, which I just put on the chat. There's also a video page that we have. Check that out. And again, thank you Cecilia. Thank you, Phillip. Excellent. So thank you everyone for joining us. And please join us next week at Edacock. We hope to see you there. Thank you.",
19,https://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUAM:CARP05569_dynmc?width=3000&height=3000,Mummy Wrapping: Figure of a Woman,Unknown,Ptolemaic period,"Despite their great cultural and historical importance, the textile arts have not been a traditional strength in government collection. Social fabrics is largely alone show, and we've had generous cooperation from our cousin institutions, Dumbart Moves in Washington, and the Museum of Fine Arts just across the river. Aside from the textile museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. For members of our audience who are not familiar with historical textiles, I hope this exhibition will provide a deeper appreciation of one of the most ancient, pervasive, and intimate art forms. Textiles touch nearly every aspect of human existence, from swaddling newborns to enshrouding the deceased. Building fabrics of function form a linean, as necessity and luxuries, but also as a medium of exchange and a form of wealth. In consumer-driven societies where fabrics are machine-made, disposable goods, it can be difficult to understand the extraordinary artistry invested in medical textiles and their value as an economic asset for individuals and the state. Conversely, the latitude given to dress as a form of personal expression in our day would have been inconceivable to a medieval Egyptian. For historians, textiles serve as important socioeconomic indicators. Their manufacture, appearance, and consumption provide vital clues to understanding societies and the place of the individual they are in. The textiles in our exhibition are particularly meaningful because they are embedded with words. The title Social Fabrics is more than a play on words. The fabric in question are a visual form of communication, expressing political and social power, commercial contacts, and concerns for the afterlife. The exhibition highlights the significance of language bearing cloths created during a transformative period in Egyptian history. In the medieval era, control of the region shifted repeatedly as Egypt was subsumed under a sequence of empires, Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbasid, and Fahunid, and the majority religion gradually evolved from pagan to Christian to Muslim. These seismic political and cultural changes are reflected in the textiles. With only 38 objects, the exhibition is not large, but it packs a lot of content. This is rich and complex subject matter. And as you can see from the title page of the exhibition catalog, I had the great good fortune to tackle it with a marvelous group of colleagues. Curators, conservators, and professors. And if you see the figures pictured at lower right, conservation fellow, Julie Wurz, and then Harvard graduate student interns, but now newly minted PhDs, Katie Taronis, and Meredith Winter. Although he's not pictured here, Professor Yohan Sokary has been essential to this effort. For this generation of scholarship, he is the expert for these textiles. He's co-editor of the catalog, and next spring in April, he will deliver the call to the Blackshire in Islamic art to coincide with the exhibition. The exhibition features 31 textiles, most were produced about a thousand years ago in Egypt, although a few came from Yemen, Iran, and Iraq. All are said to have been recovered from Egyptian graves. The core fabric stayed from the ninth through 12th centuries, and taken together, they reveal the diversity and stratification of medieval Egypt. Although they feature varied materials, techniques, and designs, they are conceptually unified by Arabic inscriptions, either present or as a paradigm, and most belong to the prized category of Tyra's textiles. Tyra's may be an unfamiliar word for many. In fact, there is much in this project that may be new ground, so I'll ask your indulgence to lay down some background information. We'll start with a general definition of Tyra's. Ben established our bearings in time and space, and finally clarified to technical teams. Tyra's were a highly prestigious form of textile. For centuries, they gave material form to a privileged network headed by the Caliph or in Ma'am, who was the temporal and spiritual leader of the Islam of the world. Tyra's with inscriptions that named the Caliph were not available for purchase on the open market. They were distributed by the ruler, either as part of annual salary disbursements to state employees, or as gifts to favored courtiers and officials. One of the most telling historical counts of the use of Tyra's can be found in the Mokadama by the great Arab philosopher historian of the 14th century, Ibn Khadun, which you see on the screen. He was describing the court practices of the Fatima dynasty, who ruled Egypt from 969 to 1171, when he wrote. One of the splendors of power and sovereignty was to inscribe their names in the borders of garments designed for their wear. Thus, the royal robes are bordered with a Tyra's. It is an emblem of dignity reserved for the sovereign, for those whom he wished to honor by authorizing them to make use of it, and for those whom he invests with one of the responsible posts of government. Tyra's inscriptions announced political and religious affiliations and sometimes expressed aspirations. But they were different from the message t-shirts or slogan hats that were familiar. The content of Tyra's inscriptions was controlled by the state, and their display functioned as a form of differentiation, communicating who could walk in the corridors of power. Now for our bearings in time and space. Our exhibition focuses on the years roughly 850 to 1150. Tyra was mature both as a concept and an industry. For comparison and context, we've included some wonderful Egyptian textiles from the Prius Longaq era. This slide hints at the tremendous political and cultural shifts that took place in the late antique and medieval era, and how the Egyptian textile industry responded. In the year 641, the Arab Muslim armies conquered Egypt. As the map it left shows, Egypt had been a prized province of the Byzantine Empire, here colored orange, whose state religion was Christianity. The Byzantine period tapestry below, there's a flowering tree with the word flourish written in Greek. Within the first century of Muslim rule, Arabic replaced Greek as the language of the ruling class and as the administrative language of government. By the 9th century, Egypt had become a province in the Abbasid caliphate. On the center map, it's the green territory simply labeled the caliphate. The Abbasids ruled Egypt from 750 to 969, although their empire endured elsewhere, their caliphate endured elsewhere until 1258. Incorporation into the Abbasid caliphate brought a profound eastward shift in cultural orientation for Egypt. As the Abbasid seat of power was in Iraq, for most of their reign, the Abbasid Imperial capital was back then. By the middle decades of the 9th century, the Abbasid aesthetic had found a distinctive expression in Therons. These are elegant but austere textons. They're usually a finely woven fabric of plain white, on which an inscription has been embroidered in a single color of silk, either red, blue or black. In this, they recall the appearance of the manuscript page. This example, the example below the map, was created in Baghdad in the early 10th century. In 969, Egypt was rested from Abbasid control by the armies of the Fahd-Midynastie, who established themselves as a rival caliphate. The map on the right is a bit confusing because of the various shades of green, but Fahd-Mid territory is the deepest green. The Abbasid domain is still labeled the caliphate, is a lighter blue green and Byzantine lands remain orange. The Abbasid and Fahd-Midnastie differed in many ways, but for our purposes, the two most important factors were first, they stood on opposite sides of one of the most important schisms in Islam, Sunnique and Shia. In a direct challenge to the Sunnique Abbasids, the Fahd-Mids claimed to be the rightful leaders of the Islamic world because of their dissent from the Prophet Muhammad through his daughter, Fahd-Midnastie. And second, the political status of Egypt changed dramatically, as control shifted from one regime to the other. Under the Abbasids, Egypt was an important peripheral province. Under the Fahd-Mids, Egypt became the heartland. The Fahd-Mids found the city of Cairo as their imperial capital. As a rival caliphate, the Fahd-Mids were largely cut off from the luxury textiles produced in Abbasid territories. To meet the needs of their extravagant court, they expanded the Egyptian textile industry with spectacular results. As the 11th century tapestry beneath the map illustrates. One of the things that I've really enjoyed as a curator has been the chance to examine works of art closely, to be able to see how a work of art is created through strokes of a brush, pen, or chisel, or, in the case of these textiles, through the manipulation of files. I think we better understand artistic achievement by knowing how the physical properties and materials are understood to create different visual effects. And by grasping how artists evolved with the possibilities for struggle against the limitation of their craft. Art is an age of machine and now digital production, but these fabrics show the hands of their makers if we work closely. I've mentioned embroidery and tapestry, so we'll devote three slides just to be sure certain everyone understands these techniques. Oops, sorry. Speaking broadly, the textile traditions, two textile traditions were brought together in Egypt in the centuries by our exhibition. We can designate them as the Western and Eastern traditions, because there are always commercial and artistic exchanges, they're separated here by a porous line. The Western tradition refers to Egypt's indigenous weaving, which primarily used linen and wool. The Eastern tradition refers to textile practices of lands to the east, specifically the taras produced in Iraq and Iran, which usually employed cotton and silk. Fibers have different qualities. The animal derived fibers are easier to die, so for taras, we usually find colored wool and silk used as the patterning elements on grounds of white linen or cotton. Also silk produces very fine and smooth threads for use in textiles. Wool threads tend to be thicker with a coarse texture. In general terms, there's a long tradition of tapestry weaving in Egypt in contrast to a strong embroidery tradition in lands to the east. There's a lot of information in this slide, but our concern is only with how pattern is created. The embroidered pattern, you start with an already woven fabric. The design is created by pulling colored threads through the fabric with needle. If you pull those embroidery threads out, you would still have an intact textile, because weaving and pattern are set there. To wear to wool silk threads, compared to wool, silk threads create less friction when pulled through a fabric, so they work well for embroidery. As expressed in taras, the abbasid aesthetic favored embroidery with silk threads on ground fabrics of cotton or silk. The diagram demonstrates the chain stitch, which was the predominant stitch in eastern taras. You can also see it in the photograph below as a pale green thread. Tapestry of course is different. A tapestry weeder builds the pattern during the process, during the weaving process itself. The picture at lower left shows a simple wound set up. The white yarns that one vertically are the wool. The yarns that run horizontally work from right to left on the left. Here blue and yellow. Pattern is created by weaving colored weft yarns just for their needed for the design. The diagram above shows the same thing. The warp is white and the weft yarns are white and black. Pattern is created through the intersecting of the warp and weft yarns. If you pull out the patterning weft yarns, you're left with bare warp. Another important difference between the two techniques concerns the grid created by the horizontal and vertical yarns on the moon. Tapestry builds on the grid, whereas embroidery threads are independent of the grid. They can move in any direction across the face of the textile. That said, tapestry weavers have always found ways to create curves and diagonal signs. As you can see in this photomicrograph of a rabbit from one of my favorite textiles in the exhibition. Until this project, my work in textiles had concentrated raw and woven silks, in which a complex line is sort of programmed to repeat certain shapes within the grid. The freedom of tapestry took me by surprise. There's a marvelous plasticity in the way that weaver can bend the patterning wefts to build shapes and fill spaces as needed for the design. From this slide, we will also realize that I've been showing you details of larger objects. This is primarily because of our digital format. On a small screen, a detail can sometimes get more information about an object than we'll draw an image. I want to stress that you will want to experience this exhibition firsthand. Textiles have a tactile physical presence. Too often, studio photography squashes the light out of them. And a computer screen further flattens their topography and homogenizes the myriad variations in color and texture. Perhaps you can see that this is a tapestry. It's the earliest to laws in the exhibition, woven in Egypt around the year 800, before the Eastern embroidery paradigm had become dominant. Now a second reason for relying on details is that almost all tiras are now deteriorated and fragmentary. This is mainly due to the very setting that preserved them, which was the tomb, in which they spent long centuries in intimate contact with human bodies. This is a rare and poignant example of a complete tiras. It preserves a full length of almost eight feet with work fringes at top and bottom, and a full movement. The top image is positioned so that the length or gorge direction runs horizontally. During its owner's life, it likely served as a cherished shawl. In death, it became a precious shroud. The full view shows dark stains regularly spaced across the length. This movingly testify to how the deceased was wrapped and laid in the grave. But the final transformation of most tiras into bits and pieces took place comparatively recently. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when there was a vote for collecting Egyptian burial textiles, although we decry the practice today, it was customary to cut apart these fabrics, preserving the pattern areas, and discarding the damaged sections. Please bear in mind that most of the tiras we'll see had a format similar to the shawl, that is, a length of mostly plain fabric with decoration concentrated near the ends. There are three sections in the exhibition. The first two focus on the Abbasid and Fadindic periods, asking what tiras' textiles meant in the lives of those who commissioned, produced, and used them. The third and final section examines the burial context, asking how tiras were used and form. The first section of social fabrics concentrates on the 9th and 10th centuries, during which tiras were essentially an expression of the Abbasid state. We'll look at just a few highlights, beginning the fist striking early 10th century vote. This visual impact derives entirely from the inscription, embroidered in deep red, on a creamy, white ground. The angular script contrasts cylinder verticals with emphatic horizontal liches. The sweeping sublinear elements propel the iron from right to left, the direction in which air that was written. This example shows not successfully Egyptian textile work is adapted to the aesthetic preferences of the Abbasid will and will lead. It also reveals that Egyptian workmanship usually employs a greater variety of embroidery stitches on a ground fabric of linen rather than cotton. Because this inscription is unusually complete, it helps clarify the content and character of these texts. Tiras' inscriptions in the Abbasid era are rather specific, and by the narrowest definition they must name the Roman caliph. In this instance the Abbasid caliph al-Mukhadeh. There are formulaic texts that resemble the language found on pointage. To have Tiras commissioned in your name was the equivalent of having points struck in your name. Both reforms of public texts that announced and reinforced your legitimacy as a rule. The inscription's generally blend administrative information and pious expressions. Control of Tiras' inscriptions, who was named in what capacity and in what sequence, was a closely guarded prerollative of the ruler and his immediate administrators. Here the text opens with blessings for the caliph, followed by the names and titles of the government officials who authorized and ordered this production. Then the workshop and the date. The sequence of officials is followed the chain of delegation. This example also identifies its production center as a Tiras workshop in tennis in the Nile Delta in the history year 301. The primary purpose of Tiras' inscriptions was to proclaim a ruler's right to exercise control. But they also offered a mean of the competing ambitions. As you'll see in the exhibition, a careful reading of these texts can provide clues to evolving hierarchies and parallel relationships. But the paradox of this art form is that the texts are often difficult to read. If you know Arabic, but are having difficulty matching the transcription with the embroidery in this time, the slide don't feel bad. Even when you know the formula, the inscriptions can be puzzling because of stylized scripts, orthographic curiosities, and even missing words. It must have been even more difficult to decipher an inscription in motion, for example, when war is a garment, which brings us to our next concept. This small tunic was probably intended for a child. I was anxious to see through this loan from the textile museum because it's the only surviving tailored garment bearing a califal tyrant's. This 1100 year old tunic allows us to envision how tyrant's were grown. The embroidered text is graded, but we can still discern the name of the Abbasid calif al-Mukhader and the date. The fact that the embroidery threads are almost completely worn away suggests that this is a secondary use for a treasured textile. We know from historical documents that some textiles were commissioned expressly to be used as shrouds, but many burial textiles reveal previous usage. In this image, the tunic is lying face down so that you can see the inscription, which is positioned on the back of the left arm. This is presumably so that the text would have been face upward when the body was laid to rest. In Muslim burials, the body is usually laid on its right side facing neck up. Although its presence is now faint, we can see that the text served as an arm bend. And in medieval Islamic art, tyros are most often depicted as arm bends, as we'll see in the next slide. We've included pictorial examples of medieval Muslims wearing tyros garments to help visitors re-embodied the many fragments in their minds as words of shaltz. But they were also fashioned into curtains, covers, and cushions. These examples from the Abbasid period conveyed their enduring bold and status over some 300 years. On the left, a luster bow from 10th century Boschow shows a seated courtyard holding a beaker. His elaborate costume includes arm bends that would have been understood as high status tyros. On the right is an early 13th century folio from the manuscript on the therapeutic properties of plants, animals, and minerals. This showy fabrics on his figures, shawl and roads, especially the elaborate gold tyros fans reflect the afflons and fashion consciousness of the Abbasid court. The textiles found in Egyptian graves reveal a region enmeshed in political and commercial networks stretching from the Indian Ocean and Eastern Iran to the Mediterranean and North Africa. In addition to linen and wool cloths from Egypt, our exhibition contains copies from Iraq, silks from Iran who read map from the Levant and is here, he cuts from Yemen. At the time this beautiful textiles produced the territorial realm in political authority of the Abbasid caliphate had dwindled dramatically, and emeers in the provinces began separating from imperial rule. Yet tyros' textiles remained a potent symbol. Tyros' fashion for rulers in Yemen, who nominally recognized Abbasid authority, are often inscribed in gold leaf, not lined in black ink. This inscription does not mention the Abbasid caliph, and instead it announces that a Yemeni in the Earth ordered his production. Yemen's striped pot and cloths will widely appreciate it in Islamic lands. The detail shows that the striping was sometimes achieved by setting up the work threads of the moon to create simple bands and alternating colors, as in the tan stripes. But the patterning could also be carried out in the technique commonly called e-cut, in which yarns were tie-died before weaving to create fluctuating gradations of blue, tan, and white. The e-cut technique originated in Southeast Asia, spreading via Indian Ocean trade to Yemen, where it then became a speciality of the earliest long era. Because it does not actually name the ruling caliph, some scholars would refer to this fabric as a tyros' style textile. For this project, we've adopted a liberal definition of tyros' to encompass tyros' style textiles, because they clearly emulate the officially inscribed textiles and are, in fact, conceptually unfeasible without them. The most successful challenge to the Abbasid regime in Egypt came from the Fahimid dynasty. The second section of the exhibition examines tyros' textiles created during their two-century reign. Soon after they conquered Egypt in 1969, the Fahimids used tyros as a symbol of the regime. In this, they were following a well-established practice, yet the content of their inscriptions signaled a decisive shift in the religious climate, as the court's allegiance switched from Sunni to Ismaili Shitan. This tyros' name is El Aziz, the second plethora of tyros' to the world from Cairo. It's a commanding work, preserving a full moon with a five feet. Louise Mackie, former curator of textiles and Cleveland, said that whenever she put it on display, visitors would simply stand before it and stare. You must come see it for yourself. A bold inscription runs above and below a decorative bend containing pairs of confronted parties. The key phrases are the reference to the calyxpure forefathers and his designation as a friend of God. These are coded expressions to assert the Fahimid's special relationship with God in the context of their descent from the Prophet Muhammad. Since their right to rule was based on this ancestral claim, the public display of such texts was one means to proselytize for their cause. With reduced access to the luxury textiles of Eastern Islamic lands, the Fahimids relied more heavily in the work of Egyptian weavers, primarily Christian Pops and Musqueurian. The Eastern embroidery technique and the stark elocid aesthetic seen in earlier tyros' were gradually abandoned and Egypt's indigenous tapestry technique and decorative repertoire were reimagined and refined to enrich tyros' textiles. This, the tapestry weavers adapted silk threads as patterning elements to create designs with fine linen or detail that would have been impossible before. Next we'll see two details just from Mr. Ones. This large tyros could have served as a shawl or even a turban cloth. The linen ground fabric was dossimoushier. On the left, the silk letters appeared to float in the light green film. Weaving reached virtuoso levels in these books. On the right, you can see how the weaver has exploited the freedom of tapestry to create a billowing texture in the white copies. The technical term for how the weaver has circumvented the grid of the loom to create these fluid shapes is non-horizontal wet, a very dry description for this poetic effect. In this magnificent tyros, woven about 1100, the sequence of decorative bands ran near the fringed end of what might have been a large shawl. This close-up shows that the weaver has skillfully maintained an even moon tension despite the very different densities of the shear linen fabric and the compacted silk tapestry. In this example, the yellow silk is particularly lustrous and gives the appearance of gold. Now let's look at the decoration, which features a wealth of figural and vegetable motifs. Potomate turos with ornamental patterns are disproportionately represented in using collections because they were particularly popular with collectors in the early 20th century. And their appeal is undeniable. The next slide will be a close-up of this turos, focusing on the wide band and the center. Here we're juxtaposing the phytonaturos with an Egyptian pattern, the Byzantine era, to demonstrate the re-invention of pre-easalmic compositions and motifs. I try part-time composition forders both works. The middle register consists of an interlacing scroll, a guillot, inhabited by animals. Designs in the upper and lower registers reflect one another, that is one set points upward the other downwards. In the Byzantine example on the left, the guillot is a vine scroll, sprouting great clusters and leaves, and it's populated by running animals, with tongues vividly rendered in red. In the outer registers, the reflected designs are rounded pernolations. In the Potomate turos, the vine scroll is abstract and inhabited by pairs of birds. The upper and lower registers are greatly expanded, and instead of simple pernolations, the reflected elements are Arabic inscriptions. In this case, the text names the Potomate caly, and the stately. The vine scroll, inhabited by animals, was the most common symbol for expressing natural abundance and the good life in late antique Mediterranean. Our Byzantine cuff band was radiocarbon dated to a range of 370 to 430, that is during the period in Egypt was becoming a majority Christian. It could well have adorned the wrist of a pagan or Christian. We continued prominence of the inhabited vine scroll in Egyptian art from late antique into the medieval era, demonstrates the fluid transfer of nature-derived iconographies across religious traditions. This unlikely looking pairing offers another example of the Potomate assimilation of preasal mid-traditions. On the left is a large covering, more than 7 feet long, but I don't believe we have ever exhibited. It's been radiocarbon dated to 417 to 535. We don't know its original purpose, but it has sections of looped pile that we have provided once, with the whole cushioning. On the right is a 12th century Potomate terrace, in real life it's much smaller than the Byzantine shrown. In both works, the texts and decoration appear to marshal protective messages to benefit the owners. The Greek text, name the private individual, and includes monks and emblems that symbolize the crucified Christ. The Arabic text, name God, the prophet Muhammad and A'li, the prophet son-in-law and the first tale of the plate dishia doctrine, and it repeats that victory comes through God. With these details, we can see that although they are separated by 600 years, both textiles are dominated by similar, long-lived decorative regimes, geometry and interlace. Geometric patterns are especially persistent and invasive, and both fabric-speecher variations on lozengers and joining circles. They also devote considerable surface area to interlace patterns, ranging from simple twining to complex braids and knots. It's been suggested that interlace patterns were understood as snares to track legal forces, which would give these textiles an additional talismanic character. Late Fadda and Idturahs, such as the three on the screen, show how Islamic and pre-Islamic decorative moths and techniques came together in medieval Egypt. We see so-called tabestries featuring Arabic conscriptions embedded in the range of late antique decorative regimes. In the hands of talented leaders, Tiraaz contributed to a fusion that helped fashion a distinctive Egyptian culture. Despite their high quality materials and execution, the two Tiraaz on the right do not name the failure. By the 12th century, the concept of Tiraaz seems to have generalized beyond its original purpose and decorative pattern became the dominant feature. The format had outlived the content. Perhaps these textiles were produced for wealthy individuals who were not part of the K-LIFT network, or perhaps they were commissioned by people who simply wanted a high status text style for personal courtesies, such as private gifting. Some of the most interesting textiles in the second section are far removed from the elite network that originally defined the Tiraaz on the street. That favorites are shawl fragments probably made in the fine region. Located southwest of Cairo, the fine room had been a bishopric in the Christian era. As we saw with the Byzantine tabestries, a tree and an exhortation to flourish, textiles bearing inscriptions in Greek or poptic, the indigenous language of Egypt, were not unknown in the prison era. Their texts, however, were usually short and functioned essentially as captions for the pictorial decoration. Some of the inscriptions, such as the fine on the fine room shawl, signal the impact of Tiraaz. As in this example, the texts may be bilingual in Arabic and poptic. The fine room shawl stand outside court circles in more than one way. Their patterning wefts are not so, but traditional, golden linen. And the writing is debased, even fanciful, suggesting they serve the less literate fun and tell. Along with the lively cast of animals, this example features virtually illogical texts. The poptic inscription seems to request divine assistance for the owner and features across an abbreviated references to Jesus Christ. The Arabic text, interspersed with protective hexagrams and birds, is perhaps a free rendition of the ubiquitous wish for blessings from God. But if you see it otherwise, I couldn't make much of an arrangement. The fine room shalls reveal the gradual interweaving of communities in Middle East. Their animal and plant motifs recall the Byzantine decorative repertoire, although the appearance of camels is a novelty in Egyptian textiles. And the presence of Arabic, neither alone, nor long-settic, shows the gradual process of language conversion. Christian and Jewish communities existed in Egypt for centuries before the spread of Islam in the seventh century, and they continue to this day. The status of non-Muslims in medieval Egyptian society was characterized by attention between integration and distinction. And they mingled with their, as they mingled with the Muslim population and worked within the state administration, they adopted Arabic as their day-to-day language. Over time, Arabic also became a predominant language of religious expression for these communities. Just when this language transition occurred, is debatable. This bilingual shawl has been radiocardundated to 770-887. The third section of the exhibition considers the presence of inscribed textiles in a burial context, acting as a coda to the preceding discussion on the use and making of two-os. In this final section, we explore about how and why these fabrics were used in the theater series. Almost all surviving teras textiles were recovered from Cairo's immense urban cemeteries, non-collectively as the Paratha. This view taken from the balloon in 1904, Pesysel. It shows the vast medieval Maconfer's of Cairo. The great northern cemetery is in the foreground and the great southern cemetery from which many teras are said to have been recovered starts at the very top right. Although most teras like the liable archaeological data, the patterns of stain and deterioration affirm their use in teras. Now the next slide is disturbing because it shows an inscribed body. In some instances, textiles were recovered according to the scholarly standards of the day, as you see in these photographs from the 1930s, where a shroud-covered body is being processed by the staff of the museum of Barabar, now the museum of Islamic art in Cairo. In the photograph on the left, the man in the lab put is marking the various shroud and outlining the area of the inscription. The inscription band was positioned over the face. In the photograph on the right, the decorated section of the teras is being cut apart. The striking of us at teras that we examined earlier is repeated here because if you look closely, you'll see the three edges are cleanly cut and the upper edge is marked with a graphite line that undoubtedly received the same treatment. The museum of Islamic art in Cairo has the largest single collection of teras, textiles in the world, numbering well over a thousand. The thousands more were unearthed by members of the antiquities trade who reported fine spots than only the most approximate manner if at all. Their primary goal was to bring objects to an international market. The museums in North America are now one of the most important repositories after these objects. Egyptian burial practices for both Muslim and Christian communities involved unfolding the deceased in multiple layers of fabric. The body was dressed in a tumultuous robe and sometimes in a continuation from visiting practice, the head or feet were laid to rest on a cushion. This teras probably served as a cover for a cushion. This red and green would not have been visible simultaneously during youth. Youth, the striking inversion, would only be observed by turning the pillow over. The fabric is mostly intact although it's possible that a fine word is missing in the green section which might have told us the location in the verction. It's one of the earliest teras in the exhibition, dateable on the basis of script and pattern to the early ninth century. We chose the green section of the cushion for the cover of the catalog because it's exceptionally beautiful and because the text literally says what was made in the teras workshop. As preparation for burial, the deceased was swayed in one or more fabric shrouds such as the eight foot shawl that was then first. And in some burials, the entire ensemble is completed with a red mat as an outer wrapping. When their owners' lifetimes, red mats were probably used as a ground cover for prayer. Very few have survived. This rare example from the mat was woven much like a text in a strong and thin. It recalls teras in the style and placement of the inscriptions running crosswise at top and bottom. The lines of text in a monumental angular script invoke a generous assortment of blessings and good wishes. Let me know. Now we turn to the more speculative matter of why inscribed textiles with present circumstances and medievalness and burials. Perhaps these fabrics have played a significant role in the lives of the deceased or their quality was moved fitting for a final resting place. The argument of this exhibition of course is that the inscriptions themselves were believed to bless the deceased and ease the transition into the effort. Central to Islamic eschatology is the belief in a day of reckoning. And also shall be brought before God and eternal justice, neither God, nor me. On the left is a mid-night century Egyptian gravestone that marked the tomb of a woman named Fatima. The text makes clear the anxiety that the apocalyptic event inspired by citing the stern, foreign verse. I quote, O ye people, fear the day when ye shall be brought to God, then shall every soul be paid what it earned and none shall be dealt with unjustly. On the right is a detail from a lady boss at Tiraas that names the caliph and also the prophet Muhammad. In some circles it was believed that the prophet might intercede on the day of judgment on behalf of those whose lives have been less imperfect. For supporters of the Fatima dynasty, the significance of Tiraas' texts was intensified. Both the boss and Fatima caliphs were honored as secular religious leaders, but the Fatima caliphs enjoyed them all in self-paste. According to his naini-shi doctrine, they were appointed by God and imbued with infallible secret knowledge derived from their kinship with the prophet's family. Similar to the prophet, but of course the best potency. The Fatima caliph was considered a source of blessing who could intercede on the day of reckoning. It seems that the mere presence of his name on those burial fabrics might transmit religious favor at a critical moment. The inscription on this Tiraas appears understated, but it proclaims its confessional allegiance. After the Muslim professional faith, it blesses the Fatima caliph outhacking, his father and all therefore honors, and then explicitly invokes the dead judgment. Tiraas' textiles served the regime and brought beauty and meaning to their owners in life or death. They affirmed the prestige of the caliphate and proclaimed the wearer's connections with the women in need. Over the course of the four centuries covered in social fabrics, the character of Tiraas encompassed both the graceful simplicity of the positive boundaries and the powerful exuberance of finding the tapestries. This last example, the name's element, testifies to the sumptuous possibilities of late Tiraas, at least for those in the upper most levels of power. The inscription names the caliphate, who was also named in the previous rather understated Tiraas, but here shining gold surrounds the inscription, literally highlighting its importance in the composition. Gold also illuminates the birds, which were probably intended as a suspicious routine. To create the gold left yarns, bin strips of metal, the wound around a thread core. The use of precious metals and textiles, as in coinage, was closely controlled by the state. Not only the highest ranking courtiers received ropes upon it, what we've told. Historical accounts of the Fadim report preserved vivid descriptions of the palace culture and then seriously furnished the gold textiles. Very few of these costly fabrics have survived. The vast majority were likely burned to recover the precious metals. The inscription hints at the tumultuous nature of al-Qaqim's 25-year reign. It reveals his foyer to subvert the direct line of succession and name his cousin, al-Qaqim, as the next caliph. Ultimately, his plan was thwarted by further palisant truth. Fragmentary, as they are now, the very textiles brought together for this exhibition, convey meaning through their inscriptions, patterns, and manufacturing techniques. They reveal the circumstances and aspirations of those who commissioned and owned them, the remarkable resilience and artistry of their makers. Some of the texts conveyed membership in the upper echelons of power, while others only imitate and the exercise of privilege. If the Fadim et Tiraas prominently declared tenets of Ismaeus and Shia, the captic blessings on shals seek to maintain Christian identity. All reflect their broader culture in which literacy is highly valued if not widespread. All are vital social fabrics that speak of process centuries to our own concerns for systems of inclusion and exclusion and how these are announced and perpetuated. My colleagues and I have brought the texts for this project to completion, even as the world struggles to contain a pandemic and the countless connections and transactions that weed together to the very fabric of society are unhold or attenuated as a result of quarantine or social distancing. To agree to a degree we could not have imagined that the outset of this project, we look forward to welcoming the public to this exhibition and I hope to see you there. Thank you.",

First, I'd like to share a formal land acknowledgement. The Harvard Art Museums and the Department of the History of Art and Architecture of Harvard University are located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusetts. The original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge, we pay respect to the people of the Massachusetts tribe, past and present, and honor the land itself, which remains sacred to the Massachusetts people. In collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of History of Art and Architecture and with the Arasmus Lectureship Committee, I'm pleased to welcome you to the second lecture in this series and the series itself is called Art and Thought in the Dutch Republic. We hope you'll join us for the next and final installment of the series on Friday, November 19th, also at 4pm. You can view more information and register on our website. I'd like to share just a few logistics about the program this afternoon. We are a hybrid audience, some in the lecture hall and some at home on Zoom. For our online audience, we're using the webinar format in Zoom. So your microphones are muted and your videos are not visible. The presentation will last approximately 40 minutes, and we will dedicate the last 20 minutes to a question and answer period. My colleague, who is here with us in person today, happily, is Eva Leier, Burkhard, the William Dorr Boardman Professor of Fine Arts in the Department of History of Art and Architecture here at Harvard, and she will moderate the Q&A session. We invite you to submit brief questions if you're at home. Questions via the Q&A box, which you should be able to access on the bottom of your screen. For those of you in our small in-person audience this afternoon, if you're in the lecture hall, you are welcome to post questions as well. Following the lecture, please raise your hand, and we will pass a microphone for you to relay your question. We will select a mix of questions from both those joining online and those in the lecture hall this afternoon. So now it's my great pleasure to introduce our esteemed speaker. Today's lecture, Sensing the Cell Early Modern Female Artists, is presented by Professor Hanika Grotenbauer. Hanika Grotenbauer is the 2021 Erasmus Lecturer on the History and Civilization of the Netherlands and Flanders at Harvard University, and is teaching a course titled Expansion and Reflection, Visual and Material Culture in the Dutch Republic. She's currently a professor of the History of Art at Roadboot University in Nimekin, the Netherlands, and prior to this, she was professor of History of Art at the University of Oxford. She is the recipient of various grants and fellowships, including the Labor Homa Trust, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, the Clark Art Institute, and the Getty Institute. Her publications include The Rederick of Perspective, Realism and Illusionism, and 17th century Dutch Still Life Painting, Treasuring the Gays, Intimate Vision, and Late 18th century iPortraits, The Pensive Image, Art as a form of thinking, as well as the co-authored Concofelia Shells Art and Curiosity in Early Modern Europe. We are honored to host these 2021 Erasmus Lectures, and I'm pleased to welcome our distinguished speaker, Hanika Grotenbauer, to the podium, both virtual and in person. Thank you, Hanika. Please come up. First of all, thank you so much for coming out today on this very rainy afternoon here in Cambridge, and also warm thanks to everyone who has connected online. And thank you very much, François and Marta, for these introductions. It's a great honor to serve as the Erasmus Lecture on the History and Civilization of the Netherlands and Flamme this year, and it has been a delight to be part of the Harvard community. I would like to thank the Erasmus Lectureship Committee, including François, Joseph Kurenner, and the Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, Robin Kelsey for this invitation. I also want to thank the Harvard Art Museums for the absolutely fabulous assistance with all aspects of my visit. In particular, Cassandra Elbinson, Erica Lolton, Joachim Holman, and Joanna, Sadenstein. I'm grateful to the Department of Art, History of Art, and Architects here for the warm, welcome that I have received, and especially to David Roxborough, and Janik, and Marcus Mayo for all their help. I also want to thank the students of my course on visual and material culture of the Dutch Republic. It has been a privilege and a great pleasure to teach you. Last week, I made a case for a new category of contemplative art that emerged in the young Dutch Republic as it made its way into maturity. A constellation of art with roots in Protestantism, it was also influenced by humanist writing. Robin and offer a narrative or symbolic meaning, contemplative art instead invites its viewers to adopt an attitude of pensiveness. I have focused on two different modalities of contemplative art. Representations of pensif figures meant to inspire scholars in their studies and to nudge them in their own work, and images that are as such, such as modesty lives by Adrian Corten, whose particular forms and composition seem to transcend the extreme realism on this display. These pensive images compel viewers to ponder what they have been startled by, and so are let away from traditional symbolic interpretations and guidance towards a mode of thinking. My notion of the pensive image is partly based on the concept of dank build or fault image employed by Samuel van Hoekstraat in his famous stritus Introduction to the Academy of Painting, 1678. The term absence from earlier treatises, such as Kyle van Mungers, 1603 Schilder book, but one that would be picked up in later treatises by Willem Gure and Gévartel Arès. The term is also inspired by the dank builder that Walter Benjamin created in the 1920s and 30s. Pensive images, characteristically, remain in expressive, or rather they give shape to the inexpressible, to that which cannot be articulated in a form of a clear meaning or message. As such, the viewer can be moved to add to the pensive image, to get in tune with the image and begin looking according to the image rather than at it. The artwork is complemented by what the spectator is called to perform. It is not a container of thought, but rather sets in motion a thinking process. Now the growing demand for small, contemplative images coincides with an increasing desire for solitude among the Dutch middle and upper class. These burrs installed small studies in their homes filled not only with books, but also with other objects, conductive of contemplation among them mirrors, shells and small paintings. Meditative practices show the interpenetration of visual, material and literary cultures. Texts of poems and philosophical and theological works, pictures, mirrors, little statues and other objects were brought together in the intimacy of the study in order to be ruminated over. These contemplative images and miniaturized objects serve to reinforce the sense that one was withdrawing from the world. The world beyond the study was temporarily called cancelled out, so to speak, when such the minute images were lifted up to meet the eye as their small skill required. Touch images are representations of pensiveness as much as they are tools that evoke it. Self-reflection, following the humanistic to know-dyself, was the main objective of such remunations, which frequently included musings about the thinkers' actual position and closed within a particular sort of space with objects in front of him in conversation with his own thoughts. I use the male pronouns deliberately here, as we have seen, access to solitude was the privilege of man. So now the question arises, to where women go when they think to paraphrase Hannah Arons. What kind of activity does their thinking involve? I will continue my exploration into interiority as a concept in visual and material culture within the domestic sphere, where we will encounter various degrees of an even more private intimate space of solitude. In the next lecture, I will look at how interiority conceived as space for thought was depicting. Paintings of domestic interiors, but also built manifestations of such spaces, including perspective boxes, dollhouses and art cabinets, served as concrete metaphors for interiority. I'm interested in the correlations running through furniture, visual artworks, and philosophical texts that deal with the spatiality and the architecture, thought. As for today's lecture, my central question concerns the opportunities for women to avail themselves of interiority. How, I want to ask, was their interiority found, described, depicted, expressed? If bookrooms and studies were exclusively masculine spaces carved out within the domestic sphere commonly regarded as the domain of women, what kind of space might women have carved out for themselves to satisfy their need for privacy? In contrast to the small paintings I showed you last week that were made up of contemplative men, professional and amateur, and were created for them, this week I would like to explore a group of images of women deeply absorbed in tasks such as spinning, sewing or lace making, usually placed in corners of larger domestic settings. These genre paintings are usually read as realistic depictions of family life, mundane, pedestrian, non-philosophical. I argue, however, within the paradigm that I laid out last week that these are depictions of contemplation not previously recognized within the traditional male paradigm for thought. The young woman here is having a white sheet that she has taken from a wicker basket beside her. Placed on a raised wooden platform to protect her from the cold-styled floor, her low chair helps her to bend over her work. She performs her task with intense concentration. Her right hand resting on a so-called sewing pillow, she cases intently at the hem of the cloth where she has just made the stitch. Her right hand is pulling the thread just far enough to tighten it. Two folded notes have been tucked under the rail of the paneling behind her. A lace-making pillow lies on the chair beside her, yet another job that will require her full attention. The darkened corners of this panel embrace her as if she has sold out the waning light of the day to complete this task. As with the image of the contemplative philosopher we saw last week, the circular shaft of light here intensifies her already intent focus. Nicholas Maas, one of Rembrandt's most talented pupils, had returned from his apprenticeship and answer them to his native city of Dordrecht, or he painted this a year or two after arriving back home. A prolific portrait painter, he also made a series of portrayals of female interiority. In both images, the seated young women, in their respective corners in their homes, bent over needlework in the last day of light, but they're also elsewhere, withdrawn from the world, in a kind of nowhere that is unreachable to us, depending on the viewers. I would suggest that these images represent a female variant of fanciveness. Depictions of female interiority have largely been overlooked as a potential category of works that would particularly appeal to female buyers, partly because of authoritarian interpretive methods that are based on emblem books. Produced by a rumor visceral or Jacob Kuts, the hugely popular emblem books for moralistic manuals meant to provide guidance to the rights and activities of ordinary life, fired a combination of an anachnetic motto, a readily understandable image, and an explanation. They are usually restrictive and domineering in their messages, in particular, when addressing women. If you want an example, Kuts marriage, who will look, lays out the six roles women take on in various stages of their lives as defined by their male family members. First, as marriageable virgin, then on to lover, bright, wife, mother, and widow. The chapter on the virgin is illustrated by a print entitled Made in Weapon of Arms, showing on the right the personification of modesty, simply dressed and holding in her hand a parrot, an exotic bird that is easily tamed and can be taught to speak while caged and is as such an attribute of docility. The figure on the left is the embodiment of the search for knowledge. It says leer searched in the label under her feet. And at her feet, we see her attributes, embroidery on the stretcher, a sewing pillow, and books. The virtues implied by such objects, the image promises us, who transform a made a made and into something beautiful akin to a precious costly tulip that will attract many bees, that is, suitors. One might apply these idealized and restrictive, moralizing images directly to serene and quiet pictures that combine needlework and books, presumably either Bibles or pattern books, so as to interpret them as the embodiments of female virtues, of the traditional aura and labor, adipray, and work tradition. However, this sort of interpretive framework not only reiterates a regime oppressive to women, but also prevents us from looking beyond the traditional opposition between scholarship and handwork. Handicraft and thinking have traditionally been seen as contrasting gender detectives, with handicraft serving as a sort of knowledge offered to women instead of a study of languages or scholarly work. Even the clever daughters of the famous emblem is Rumor Vischer, Maria Tesoschade and Anna, were widely celebrated for their various accomplishments, including their achievements in poetry and closing craving in swimming and the design of emblems, so now do to their father's profession. Yet their education mostly entailed extending the variety of handwork, since their father did not allow them to study classical languages, and, ensured, they would not lead the life of a seventh. The young women in master's painting may not yet have been prepared to make the subversive stitch. However, although the woman's focus is on the needness of the cloth hem, our eyes are drawn to the upheld needle which following the instructions of Daniel Hainius, writer of Mirror of Elistra, Honorable, Valiant, Virtuous and Wise Women, was healed as the weapon of womanhood. It is precisely the needless weapon that literally needed to be put down so that one might take up the fight for self-possession. When Anna Maria von Schirmann, one of the most elustrous of women of the 17th century, encouraged one of her female friends to study, the letter that is sparingly responded by asking how this could be, as she had only been trained, quote, to do needle work and embroider all kinds of throws. von Schirmann herself referred to as self in embroidery. The Claire is in one of her publications, that, and I quote, there are some who declare that spinning and the handling of the needle provide enough workspace for women. But she adds that she refuses to take on this rule, as she is listening to the voice of reason and not to an adopted habit. Following these images by Mass and from me are there many more. I suggest that we see handwork and study, not in opposition of each other, but that we should regard such work in its full complexity of a form of craft that is involved with pensiveness and with the act of thinking. Or the growing number of images featuring women absorbed in thought while sewing and reading were, I think, a response to the debate on the equality of men and women, regarding their pursuit of knowledge. The opposition between scholarship and Vimo virtue, between the needle and the book lay at the heart of the uncoing discussion that Jakob Kats, among other moralist writers, was well aware of. And that is referred to as the Karel de Femme, the Karel of women. The matter in question was not only whether women should be educated, but what they would do with the ability to think. Not just the book, but the needle too was a contested, was contested as well as a subversive item. I would like to present an alternative view in which book and needle are intimately linked by combining the imagery of immersive women with Martin Haydacker's definition of thinking. In his lecture series entitled What is called Thinking, Haydacker explains that the activity of thinking is not the privilege of professional philosophers, but occurs outside of the discipline by amateurs as it were. The universal activity of thinking is closer to an authentic craft than to a full-blown profession. All the work of the hand is rooted in thinking, Haydacker assurances. Perhaps thinking too, he muses, is a craft, a handicraft. In this lecture, I will look at a role of handwork and the relationship between women's scholarship and Vimo virtue within the broader field of women's creative and scholarly practices in 17th century Netherlands. Haydacker's definition of thinking as a handicraft that falls outside of any official profession will serve as a guiding pillar in this lecture. For creative practices for women, work complicated affairs. The work of the scholar artist, Anna Maria Vasturman called the Star of Utrecht and the lesser known Margherita van Hodeweg named the Pearl of Utrecht, revealed their constant struggles to align their high profile positions as learn it, gift it and accomplished women with reigning expectations of typical female modesty, piety and elegance that express themselves through all kinds of handwork. Most women artists were surprisingly restless in their practice. For instance, Margherita Maria de Roderen, who we see here presented as an oil painter, as well as a daughter seated in between her mother and a portrait of her father that she has just completed. She was praised for her embroidery, calligraphy and clasen craving as well. Judith Leister and Maria van Hodeweg were exceptional in this regard as they managed to establish themselves as professional female painters in a male dominated world by adapting themselves to that world standard. Both worked in the dominance medium of oil paint and each committed herself to one particular genre which was the standard practice as the time. Each was an exception to the rule because each played by the rules and they were both confident and highly successful. With one arm on the back of her chair, Leister leans unapologetically backwards in her famous self-portrait, smiling, nodded all faced by the judgment of her visitor viewer, directed either towards her work or towards herself. One of the few women artists who did not devote her art to so-called feminine topics such as flowers, insects or still lives, she instead took on genre painting, a category distinct for its stereotypical portrayal of femininity. Leister graphs her portrait carefully so as to combine her profession with her role as a cultivated woman. The hand that holds the palette also grasps a cloth so that she can wipe her brushes in her fingers, hinting at the messy business of painting. Her rough, however, signals her fashion ability. We are subtly informed that each of these two persona can only partly eclipse the other. It is impossible for her to finish her jolly fitler without smudging the white lace. Maria van Osterhijk had herself formally portrayed as a cultivated woman, one hand holding her palettes and brushes while the other leaves through a book. However, in her famous ponytail image, she creates a more complex self-portrait in the reflection of the bottle on the left that is labeled aquavita, the water of life or life-giving water. Her portrait is reflected on the field part of the bottle so that her image is immersed in the life-giving water. The act of painting, this painting is giving her life, she seems to say. Painting is her life's work. A woman artist who enjoyed extraordinary fame and more way more than a lister or Osterhijk was not a painter at all, but a paper cutter. Johanna Courten was an internationally renowned figure who commanded high prices for her work, which she displaced in her home in Amsterdam that doubled as a studio. Her exhibits drew prominent visitors from all over Europe, and her contemporary esteem was better preserved than our artwork, so fragile that few examples have survived. Her husband has played a significant role in promoting his wife's art and reputation, which was extended after her death by the so-called Stamblok, a very extensive long album, he curated, comprising poems, drawings and other expressions in her honor. Courte created a variety of compositions, including flower paintings and portraits of illustrious figures. Her style of cutting is painterly and aspires to illusionistic effects, usually reserved for oil painting. Even though she never touched a brush, brush, she is, like Lister and Osterhijk, the subject of one of the entries published in Arnold von Halbreckens, a volume of artist, biographies and titles, great theater of artists. On Halbreckens' page, author and tojastic page on Courten representing her as one of the greatest artists of her time. A drawing by him places Courten, Courten, sorry, firmly on the throne of art, lifting a pair of scissors in one hand while holding a palette and brushes in the other. A hammer and chisel at her feet refer to commentaries by Herod Myerus, whom marvels at the sculptural character of her figures that seem to have been carved out of stone. And her work that used to be largely lost and forgotten is actually currently albeit gradually enjoying a revival. Courten's greatest competitor was Rotterdam based Elizabeth Ryberg, and she was as famous, but we know very little of her, whose paper curiosities as they were called, likewise drew a great number of visitors to the shop she ran out of her home. By she excelled in seascapes, flower pieces and portraits of royalty, she showed herself to be a genuine sculptor in painting, in creating three-dimensional perspectives that may have resembled the cutout spheres. The woman figure is holding here. The spheres are reminiscent of astrolaves that usually symbolize intellect, but they probably were meant as bridal presence. Ryberg charged an entry fee to the visitors who flocked to her house, which stood out because of the inscription on its shop sign. And I quote, I cut from paper all that pleases the eye, or artworks are able to evoke in a lively mind. Even if jealousy, criticism, is roaring with jewels wide open, my art won't be affected by it. And it's a real shame that none of Ryberg's ingenious sculptural paper cuttings have survived. Paper cutting was not a typical female art in art form in the 17th century. It was only when artist and hacker writer Jakob Kampowajerman in his biographies of the Nadelandish artist, published in 1729 declared the scissors the art instrument of the female sex. That's paper cutting began to decline. Now from Hobrath, I'm observed that male artists were usually not very studios. Indeed, throughout the 17th century, artists typically owned between 20 and 40 books, which included familiar titles such as Carol from Wonder Schilderbrook, Francis Union's Schilder Const and Cesare Ripas iconology. However, recent research on the libraries of female artists rendered at my home institution has revealed that Kourtins' library was extensive and did not mainly consist of religious books as has often been assumed regarding early modern book ownership by women, but also included literary works, such as Place by Yost van de Fondel, as well as scholarly and philosophical texts by Dezidere's Erasmus, the Jurist Hugo Grotius and the Medical Man Johann von Beaverweg. Kourtins' uncle, a Hendrik Glasmacher, was a translator of Descartes, Spinoza and the Quran. When Jakob Haubraken painted Kourtins together with Anna Maria von Schürman in a double portrait, he brought together not only two of the most remarkable women of the century, but also two extraordinarily gifted figures who combined scholarship and artistic practice. The ambiguity of the relation between thinking and handwork emerges more clearly when we take a closer look at Spirman, whose position is exceptional on all accounts. She mastered at least 12 languages, some say 14, some say 18, including Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic, possessed an extensive knowledge of theology and philosophy and corresponded with scholars all over Europe. In addition to her intellectual endeavor, she excelled in a variety of crafts, a typified female artistry, including embroidery, calligraphy, a class engraving, wax modeling, miniature carving, as well as painting and pastel and watercolor and printmaking and paper cutting. So this is her version of paper cut art. Schürman provides an answer to the question as to why non-professional women artists maintain such a varied practice, as she explains in her autobiography that she learns the various techniques of wax sculpting, paper cutting, embroidery and calligraphy all without a master. That she was an out-of-the-dark, may reveal incontrovertibly how talented she was, but we should also note that materials for needlework, calligraphy and paper cutting, as well as pattern books and manuals were widely available, and the practice of these arts required no special studio space, as these pursuits were often performed at a table or in one's lab. Women in general were able to become proficient in these arts within the domestic sphere, requiring no further assistance or creative ventureships. In that regard, Hentwo was one of the few ways open to independent female creative exploration. Schürman describes passionately how, when she was still young, the practice of these arts fulfilled her desire for self-advancements, noting with pride the discoveries she made in applying these various techniques. When High Decorative Finds Thinking, not as the activity of a profession, the broader as a form of authentic Hentwo, he describes it as a process of learning that is at the same time a process of unlearning, as his non-professional way of thinking needs to set aside what thinking has always been. In learning an authentic craft, one learns in response to the material that one works with. The way one acquires knowledge is not just through practice, but also by answering, so to speak, the very material that one practice is with. It is in this answering to what is given that thought is crafted, high-deferred serves. Schürman describes herself exploration in various crafts in similar terms. When she sets her hands to work, she writes, her mind is filled with heavenly thoughts. Her new inventions were completely absorbing. She was particularly proud of a wooden self-portrait in miniature that we see here mounted in a box, and also of another one in wax, which is lost, which took 30 days to complete, as she writes, there was much about this art that no one could teach her, and that she had to find out for herself. The greatest asset of this small piece, apparently, was the shine of the eyes, which seemed to turn towards the viewer when the little box was turned around. Similarly, through her new invention, the diamonds aroused in the next spark of naturally as well. After this authentic account of having taken pride in her own work, Schürman takes a typical early modern female u-turn and immediately asks what such work was for, reprimanding herself or her fanaty in attaching herself to this sophisticated self-portrait. Another self-portrait continues the rhetoric of modesty in an image tellingly not showing her hands, which carries an inscription. Night in my mind's arrogance, nor my physical beauty, has urged me to engrave my portraits in everlasting bronze. It was rather the impulse not to work on a more dignified subject on my first attempts. If perhaps, this crude stylists were forbidding better ones, meaning her crude stylists, meaning her untrained hands that are here and seen. These cleverly composed words of modesty could not prevent an invitation to become a member of the St. Luke's Guild in Utskveth, where she enrolled as a painter, sculptor, and printmaker. Her great fame was generated, however, by her philosophical treetuses, including the one that addressed the question at the heart of the Karel de Fum and titles, the learned maid or weather and maid, maybe a scholar. René de Kartou definitely have answered this question positively. His work, emphasizing the universality of reason, was specifically addressed to thinkers without formal university training, i.e., women, and had opened up a path for female readership. He put forward the famous claim that philosophy, napluan, the sex, philosophy has no gender, and was initially very supportive of Svirmann, though he was less enamored of the increasing influence of the professor of theology, Futeus, under whose tutelage she had placed herself. Another text advocating female education was Johan von Bevreweig's of the excellence of the female gender, first published in 1639. This treat is largely agreed with that card when it argued against the R.A.R.A.S tutel's view on women as incomplete men and a certainty in quality, or perhaps even superiority of women in human virtues and deffos. The hefty volume records a long list of historical, as well as contemporary examples of female excellence as scholars, authors, and artists in support of the arguments, and includes not only the famous names of Svirmann and Van Hoenweg and Ruhmord Visser, but also those of women whose fame did not extend beyond their own circles. Even though the absence of moralism for fleshing, von Bevreweig merrily provides an overview of the status quo that shows that in excellent women indeed existed, he makes no recommendation about what might be done to strengthen their position. Close friends with von Bevreweig, Svirmann was grateful to him for endorsing her way of life and for granting women, and I quote, the access to this sanctum of Minerva was with wisdom, that all the men insisted was not open to them. Yet the question was, where this sanctum of Minerva was to be located? Even Foyse's joining von Bevreweig in favor of equality of the sexist to study had reservations about women physically entering the institutionalized sanctum of Minerva, the university. The French Jesuit Pierre Lamoine brought forward a large practical reservation that again builds on the opposition between book and needle. And I quote, all that I've said, however, my intention is not to summon women to college. I don't want to turn them into women with diplomas or change into, or change into astrolabes and spheres, their needles and wool bobbins. I respect too much the boundaries that separates us. And I quote, the spite such opposition, Svirmann was the first women in the Netherlands to cross the threshold of an institutionalized sanctum of Minerva. In 1636, Futeus allowed her into his lectures, but the prize involves overexposure through this regard. She was seated in a closet-like space separated from the baffled stairs of her fellow male students by a lettuce script. This miniature portrait probably made before she entered university for Shadows' the ambiguous position she occupied. Despite her great fame, Svirmann had a life-long desire to remain hidden. Even though she bitterly complained that households duties and the care for family members had prevented her from studying for over 20 years, she argued that confinements to the household did not mean that women should not be educated. However, for that to be possible, the notion of privacy had to change. Whereas privacy means for men not publicly active, this was not a category that women could attach themselves to. Svirmann suggests that a woman can become a prevatist, a person who has leisure for serious learning within the domestic sphere. A female thinking and learning was to take place within the domestic sphere where it is women go when they were thinking, again referring to Hannah Arons' famous phrase, and what did they do while thinking? For the depiction of female interiority that we have discussed, Marx's shift in genre painting around mid-century that is evidence in a print series by Amstam-based artist Fertrout. Hochmann that shows the same kind of intense interiority we have seen before, but this time it is depicted from a distinctly female perspective. In this series, Hochmann produced images exclusively of women working. Heavy household labor is here privatized and made exclusively a woman's experience. Absorbed in her task, she has turned her back to the viewer and is represented as if no one were there to see her. Hochmann alternates her depiction of women, grouching and scrubbing, with serene and quiet scenes similar to dose of mass of mere, in which other tasks are performed when they have time off from heavy work. However different from mass or from mere, Hochmann's creation suggests that sewing was more than a household task to carry out in instance of idleness. She presents it as a moment of meditation that allowed women to engage in reflection, on time, labor and their position within a world where public and private spaces were defined by task and gender. The female figure here is inspecting the weaving of a piece of cloth, perhaps to count its threads, to prepare it for an embroidery. The sharp shaft of light falls onto the material in her lap, seemingly piercing it as if it were a needle. Only her head and upper body are placed in the light, all objects are in the shadow. At the table in front of her are a few books, a hefty volume stands upright while not are as open. On the floor behind her is a curling piece of paper with a skull on top of it. While this is no vanity as image by traditional standards, the connection linking the books, the clock and the skull recalls meaning of such images. The situation in Wachmann's print is different as the connection is made between the works on the table, which have the same weight as they would have in the vanity as image, but here their linkage is a subject to be contemplated by the sewing woman. The clock, so obviously ticking time away in vanity's imagery, is here a reference to her time rather than the concept of such. By placing the skull behind the woman, Wachmann indicates that it is an afterthought rather than the main object of reflection, or perhaps it is a mere reference to the nature of this woman's thought that reaches ontological depths. Unlike what takes place in a private study, which may feature actual skulls, images of them, or miniature renderings as we've seen last week, and which are usually inhabited by men, this woman's reflections unfold within her living quarters. Her books laid out on the table in front of her while she devotes herself to her handwork. And time is the issue here, Margherita von Gaudewijk, another servant and artist, frequently reflects in her work on her constant lack of time to devote to her practice. Perhaps not as gifted as Khrumann. Gaudewijk was nonetheless prolific in several languages, including Latin, Greek, Italian, French and English, and she is excelled in creating landscapes and seascapes in silk and mastery art of glass engraving. She was also in touch with prominent thinkers, churches, consenayne, Huygens, and Jakob Katz and fellow citizens, Samuel von Hoogstrazen, later portraits. Imanual Kant once wrote that the hand is the window to the mind. And the hand may well have been on Haudewijk's mind when she worked on a series of emblems, one of them showing a simple landscape, a hand reaching out from a cloud holding a quill that draws a surprisingly straight line on what seems to be a slap of stone rather than a blank page. The Latin title gives the ancient maxim, Nula Diaz, Sina Linia, no day without a line, and the subscript says, no day should go by unless a line is drawn. It will only be practice, which makes great creations. Now the reference to the line remains ambiguous. It could refer to drawing, writing, or perhaps calligraphy, each of these arts that each of these being arts that hold with master's. Or its straightness could be presented here as an index of rational design, or the dichotomy of dialectical thought. In fact, if we look closely, the pen is not actually drawing a line, but instead tracing it, an act that aligns with Haudewijk here copying an emblem from Gabriel Hollenhaegens' selectorium emblematum, which articulates the ambiguity even further, Lohenhaegens' image is referring to ancient Greece and Plinity Elders for counting in his national philosophy, the custom of the painter Appelus to practice drawing every day regardless of how talented he was. So this line could also directly refer to the art of painting. The accompanying poem in Dutch, called Haudewijk's own edition, mentioned the hand also as getting mental grasp when linking practice to both craft and scholarship. And it reads, let no day pass, but write something with the hands, be eager, practice, you will learn. You will learn by and by. So craft will increase your scholarship. She used to work a baton's hub, scholarship science, basically. And you will also be of service to the Fatherland. In another poem, profiting her devotion to one line a day practice, entitled, on my engraved rumors, referring to those rumor classes, Haudewijk writes that she can only devote herself to her art, when I have been relieved of care and homely matters. And only then she can take in her room, a rumor in her hand. And I think what is intriguing here in this short poem is the fact that apparently Haudewijk had a room of her own, a place where she could retire from housekeeping activities and find time to practice her craft and her scholarship in productive isolation. Scrumom had a study too. Constan Halton's refers to it in poems composed in Latin as a museum that was apparently filled with objects and may have included pieces by her own hand that I've just shown. However, these two upper middle class learners, women were exceptional. As we have seen, women do their handwork in shared spaces where they could... Women do their handwork in shared spaces where they could be interrupted by visitors or playing children. Their intimate space is reduced to the space between their hands and their labs, which can only be separated by their utmost concentration. They might, however, have found a private space in the form of the sewing pillow that most of them had on their labs. These sewing cushions, though often described as luxuries, can be found off the labs of elite women as well in servant's knees. The velvet-peded cushions may look simple on the outside, but they conceal elaborate, decorated, interiors. The ingenious construction comprises of two sides that are joined on one side by large stitches so that it can be folded open. Inside are various wooden compartments with lids, presumably meant for silk, scissors, and needles, but in which all kinds of small things would be kept. Significantly, such sewing pillows always contained a mirror fixed to one of the compartments lids. Serving probably a similar function to that of the large tyon pockets, that 18th century British women carried under their skirts. These pockets shielded from the eyes of others were often the only space of privacy enjoyed by these women, in particular of the servant class. Sewing boxes, sewing boxes may have similarly have served an intimate zone within the domestic, a space carved out in between one's hand and one's labs, one's hand and labs. Next week, I will continue to talk about a further segregation of the so-called private sphere in more intimate zones shaped by various containers, such as boxes and cabinets that will all resemble domestic interiors. The focus will be on patronel oratement, collector, thinker craftsman, and master builder of a dollhouse as an emblem becoming real. Thank you.",

Heda,1643,"Hello everyone, I'm Cassandra Alvinson, head of the Division of European and American Art at the Harvard Art Museums. On behalf of Martha Tadeski, Elizabeth, and John Moore's Cabot Director of the Museums, it's my great pleasure to introduce our speaker this afternoon, Hanukkah Ruthenbor. First, I'd like to share a formal land acknowledgement. The Harvard Art Museums and the Department of the History of Art and Architecture are located on the traditional and ancestral land of the Massachusetts, the original inhabitants of what is now known as Boston and Cambridge. We pay respect to the people of the Massachusetts tribe, past and present, and honor the land itself, which remains sacred to them. In collaboration with our colleagues in the Department of History of Art and Architecture, and the Erasmus Lectureship Committee at Harvard University, I'm pleased to welcome you to the first in the series of lectures, entitled, as you can see, on the screen, art and thought in the Dutch Republic. And now I'll share some logistics of the program this afternoon. We're using the webinar format in Zoom, so you'll notice that your microphones and your videos are muted. The presentation by Hanukkah will last for approximately 40 minutes, and then we'll have about 20 minutes of Q&A. David Roxborough, the chair of the Department of History of Art and Architecture at Harvard will moderate the Q&A session. We invite you to submit questions via the Q&A box at the bottom of your screen. We also have a small, invited in-person audience this afternoon. For those of you in the lecture hall, you're of course welcome to post questions as well. And following the lecture, please raise your hands, and I'll pass a microphone for you so that you can relay your question. And we'll try to select a mix of questions from both those joining online and those in the lecture hall. Now I'm pleased to introduce our esteemed speaker. Hanukkah Brutenborg is the 2021 Erasmus Lecture at Harvard University, and this semester she's teaching a course for some lucky students here entitled, Expansion and Reflection, Visual and Material Culture in the Dutch Republic. Hanukkah, as you heard, is currently a professor of the history of art at Redbound University, Niemokken in the Netherlands, and she was also a professor of history of art at the University of Oxford. She's the recipient of numerous grants, lectureships and fellowships, including from the Lieberhume Trust, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, the Clark Art Institute, the Getty, and now of course Harvard University. Hanukkah's publications include the rhetoric of perspective, realism and illusion in 17th century Dutch still life painting, and her most recent published this year, The Pensive Image Art as a Form of Thinking. I'm very pleased to welcome our distinguished speaker to the podium. Hanukkah, thank you. We look forward to your talk. Thank you so much, Fram St Cassandra, for these wonderful introductions. It is an honor and a great delight to serve as the Erasmus Lecture on the history and civilization of the Netherlands and Flamers this year. And I would like to thank the appointment committee, including Fram Spappen and Joseph Körner, and as well as the Dean of the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, Robin Kelsey for this invitation. I also want to thank the Harvard Art Museums for their fabulous assistance with all aspects of my visit, in particular Marta Zadeski, Cassandra Elbinson, Erica Lolton, Joachim Homan, and Johanna Scydnstein. My deep-felt thanks to the departments of history, art and architecture for the exceptionally warm welcome that has been given to me, especially to David Roxbro and Janik and Marcus Mayo for their assistance. And I also want to thank the students of my course on visual and material culture of the Dutch Republic for their enthusiasm and their lively debates. And it has been a privilege and a great pleasure to teach you. We begin at the end of the 17th century, in 1698, when the painter Adrian Korte, from Middleburg, Zeeland, created a small assemblage of five shells carefully laid out in a corner, dramatically lit as if by theater food lights. Korte initiates a competition between Naturalia and Artifice, intending to make the already perfect shell shapes even better by painting them with utmost attention. A beautifully black and white spotted Sirarium Pika, placed on its sides with its aperture facing us, is flanked by a smaller, trona, stercoraria, its slit opening in line with a highly decorative skeleton shaped shell, its spine scaring, it as if it were a multipot insect. The tiny picture is utterly unassuming, even more so considering that it is slightly smaller than an eye pass. Such modesty is surprising in light of this painting's historical position at the till end of the monumental 17th century still-life tradition, which was given over to excessive display of exotic foods and expensive commodities in so-called punk still-lives, for example, by Jan Davidsson de Ham. Jux de Post with this artist's celebration of the census. Korte's scene is devoid of any kind of visual extravagance. There are no bright, streaming colors, no towering heaps of foodstuffs, no shimmer or shine. Its understated dimensions and muted color palette make it seem almost apologetic about the little it has to offer. The fact that this simple scene, although rendered in oil, is painted on cheap paper, clued to cardboard, often recycled pages from an old account book, only adds to its apparent humbleness. Compared to the experience of over-the-top theatrical excitement offered by De Ham, in a work so bombastically performed for us as spectators, Korte's is small, plain, and somehow very silent. Because of its small size, we have to make an effort to actually see it. We must move closer and bend towards it in order to study the peculiarities of the shell's outlandish forms. Is it only then that we can start to feel ourselves becoming a little lost in this painting? Are we only now confronted by the sudden thought that there might, in fact, be more to this image than what is ostensibly being offered to us? For what comes to the fore via the sharp outlines of these shells and are all inspiring shapes projected against the black backdrop is precisely the formlessness of their gaping holes, spiraling deep into the core of their figures. This depth of space is unexpected and perhaps a bit threatening. A popular 17th century Dutch poet once wrote, and I quote, it would be a good thing if men would turn into his own shell and think to himself, what was I before I was born? Korte's shells may have inspired people to look inwards and to consider their spiraling form as a model for the ascension of thought. Korte seemed to have been interested in the moment when a realistic representation of familiar objects become somehow less familiar so that the viewer is startled. In another minimalistic piece, a brown butterfly flutters over the fruit. It's astute feelers, conspicuously poised against the black backdrop. In contrast to the nocturnal obscurity stretching out behind it, the stone latches bathed it in a shaft of early morning light. A little butterfly or moth seem to have sought out a bright light, having just come into its narrow beam. This painting again is very small because you should put the size of the US letterhead. And its diminutive size makes observing these beautiful peculiarities a private, even intimate experience. Korte's realism is astonishing. Chipped here and there along his edges, the latch is adorned by his intertwined, signatory initials and a single, surprisingly straight crack. The crack is perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the table surface. Its razor sharp edge catching a shard of sunlight. We viewers today know of other decisive cuts in the history of painting, for instance, the zips of Barnett Newman that run through bright-collar fields. As with Korte's painting, Newman's cuts seem as if light were emanating from them. Better suggestive of an opening or closure is zero or a joint, Newman's cuts have been understood as a means of liking the earthly, linking the earthly to the sublime. Just opposing Korte with Newman reveals that the perpendicular crack in the latch does not stand alone. It is part of a fundamental figure that cuts invisibly through the image's darkness, sharply defining the butterfly's exact position to its right, laying a Harris distance from its feelers. Where is the little butterfly going anyway? Is it attempting to cross the invisible line? What is otherwise quite a sweet picture becomes a rather disconcerting image? The sense of restlessness and unease is also palpable in still life with two walnuts from 1702, which is one of Korte's smallest picture, the size of a mere postcard, and thus perhaps the most thought-provoking of his works. Two giant walnuts emerge from a cave like space. The one on the left has rolled away from the edge, but like the skeleton shell, the one on the right occupies the more prominent triangular position outlined by the crack. Both are surrounded by utter darkness. Now, the usual features of Korte's compositions have been repeated here, something seemed to have become unhinged. Though the walnuts are not quite bursting out of the frame, they are too closely crossed to comfortably occupy a box-like space where they find themselves. What is happening here? Studying their bare shells, vaguely reminiscent of skulls or brains, we viewers are as much in the dark as the nuts literally are. Shot up like clams, revealing not much more than their outer shells. They nonetheless assert themselves, push themselves forward. These representations of nuts, shells, or matlars offer something beyond the mere pleasure of looking at them. In order to choose his subjects well, with an eye to linking them with larger concepts for the viewer to contemplate, patience, for instance, in the case of the matlars, with can be eaten only after they have been left to ripen for weeks until they are almost rotten. The shells, rich and strange, plucked from the bottom of the sea, evoke the far flung oceanic realms that produce them. They have found a new home, as sought after collector's items in the curiosity cabinets of Dutch merchants, but they remain the former houses of now-dead sea creatures and are essentially vacant. As for the clamshirt walnuts and the way to mentally correct them open, we will hear more about that soon. These startling images call upon viewers and arrest their thoughts. They are not bound in these paintings, but it is unclear who is thinking them. These deeply contemplative images trigger thought and we may characterize them using a 17th century Dutch term as a dank build. Dank build brings together dank which means thought and build which means image. The dank build is thus literally a thought image. The notion of thought image plays an marginal yet crucial role in Samuel von Hoekstra and 1678 Hefty Threatis, in the introduction to the Academy of Painting or the visible world. The art of painting is a science for depicting all the ideas or thought images which the entirety of visible nature can provide and for deceiving the eye with outline and color. Besides being a highly successful painter who enjoyed international renown, von Hoekstra was also a gifted playwright and poet who as this portrait printed in the Threatis illustrates often traded his brush for the pen. Threatis makes the ambitious claim that the art of painting is a distinct cognitive activity uniting the artist's hand and eye with the intellect. On Hoekstra does understand painting and philosophy to be sister art and according in his view and accordingly in his view the activities of making and thinking are intertwined. His lost volume, the invisible world, the companion to this book on painting, presumably dealt with philosophy, a field in which he was fully conversant. The science of art that von Hoekstra had in mind should be a means of making invisible thought visible in realistic recordings of reality. On Hoekstra's employees, the term dank build to refer to invisible thought that inherits within the representation of the visible world, something that cannot be found in nature but can be formed only in the mind, i.e. a conceptual idea. The notion of dank build helps him distinguish those images that imitate reality perfectly from the thought images that somehow transcends such realism, so as to capture a deeper idea. He struggles to pinpoint where such power of thought comes from. The art of painting is capable, the rise of giving birth to a dank build, when artists have ruled over an entire composition at length, or when such a composition has been generated, not on the basis of visual perception, but through a manifestation of inner imagination. Now, Quart's biography is shrouded in mystery and we can't know how long he pondered his composition, but the fact remains that his compositions stop viewers in their tracks, who can't be sure what exactly is being represented, beyond a shell, a medlar, or a well-knut. And these works, in my view, signal instances of dank build. In these lectures, I will make a case for Dutch artworks that manifest a distinct philosophical dimension. I am interested in what I call pensive images, like Quart's medlar or shells, that offer us a thought rather than a symbolic meaning or a narrative. Rather than presenting us with a spectacle worth seeing, this stoppers in our tracks, wondering what it is that strikes us, of what this image is doing to us. Instead of getting a grasp of what a pensive image is about, we are grasped by it. It does not invite interpretation, but defies it. Instead of giving us grounding, it senses floating. And this is what the pensive image does. It puts us off, Quart. But it does something in return, as it gives shape to our thought. In these three lectures, I explore art as a form of thinking in different modalities. As an image or model of thought employed by philosophers, as models of integrated thought, as sides providing a space for reflection, and as vehicles that have triggered the thoughtful encounter for viewers across history up to the present. In my second lecture, I will look at how representations of women absorb the needlework, such as sewing or lace making, invite female audiences to reflect on the private sphere that does not offer them much privacy. Starting from Heidegger's definition of thinking as a craft, and he literally says a handicraft, I will show painting, printmaking, calligraphy and embroidery, sorry, how painting, printmaking, calligraphy and embroidery were for women artists and women scholars, modes of self-expression, as well as a way for them to craft thought. In my third lecture, I will demonstrate how the representation of Dutch interiors in 17th century Dutch visual material culture was deeply linked with notions of interiority and self-afflection. In addition to painting, I will also show those houses and perspective boxes and cabinets and other kinds of containers as instances of interiority. These lectures will follow from the more general case that I would like to make today for Dutch painting as a form of contemplative art. I will present still life painting as a philosophical genre pair of excellence that is particularly suited to contemplative artworks. I'm interested in the extent to which still life with an F is needed for stills lives with a V in the sense that works in this genre provide solitude and silence required for a genuine conversation with itself as Montenna called thinking. My aim here is twofold. I make a theoretical point in arguing for a philosophical art history that considers art to be a form of thinking and I put for an historical observation about the specific conditions in the Dutch Republic that gave rise to realistic representations that are deeply contemplative. The small creations by Coertern are emblematic of a trend in Dutch visual culture from the beginning of the 17th century onwards showing increasing awareness of and a growing demand for pictures possessed of a philosophical dimension. To their compositions, moods and distinct structure of the dress, such pictures invite viewers then and call upon us now to engage in reflection. These images I'm sure most of you know all too well, but though individual works may have been described as thoughtful, serene or philosophical, they have seldom been contextualized within a particular contemplative strand running through the culture of the Dutch Republic. For those visual culture, indeed, is a wash with contemplative works. Rambler himself portraits are typically introspective as hard as fictive depictions of philosophers, such as Aristotle with the bust of Homer showing the great thinker resting his hand on the blind seer's stone hat as if seeking his support, absorbed in thought his inward gaze mimics Homer's empty eyes. Other examples include Johannes Vermeer, whose woman holding a water picture, epitomizes an instance of serenity and thoughtfulness that does not stay within its frame, but seems to reach out even to today's viewer. There is a well-known anecdote recounted by the author Lawrence Bessler in the title essay of his 2004 collection for Meer in Bosnia about a distinguished Italian jurist presiding over the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal in the Hague. Day in, day out, this jurist had to listen to stories of cruelty and atrocity, and when asked how he managed to cope with his disturbing accounts, he explained to Wessler that he would regularly make his way to the Mauritius Museum to experience to calm and centredness of Vermeer. Scholars have observed that Peter the Hague's renderings of the sensible world of everyday experience make the claim that everydayness should be raised to the level of the monumental. The most mundane scenes were leveraged with the care and attention given to history painting, and indeed everything was depicted in Dutch visual culture, crying children, drinking peasants, sleeping servants, or indeed figures waiting or pausing in doorways as we see here. His artist been called an art of describing, but it was, in a dead sense, primarily an art of selecting. From host hath a proudly explains that Dutch painting was flourishing because artists using their own environment as sources of inspiration knew how to choose subject matter worth recording. Their approach in selecting what to depict sersism means of mining the everyday life of the Republic, and they found great treasures. From host hath a compare painting to pearl fishing, just as a beautifully shiny pearl can almost accidentally be found within a rather ugly shell, so too can painting provide its audiences with ephemeral gems plucked from the quotidian rounds of ordinary life. The strategy that van Holst had to describe for 17th century artists is not unlike Walter Benjamin's method employed in the 1920s and 30s, of finding flashes of what he called theoretical insight in everyday mundanities when he roamed the street of Berlin. These encounters gave rise to miniature prose poems published under the title Dankbeelder Thought Images, a term that he, in turn, had excavated from early modern theoretical writing. My argument for considering artworks as a form of thinking is also rooted in the writings of Hannah R. N. S. Her masterpiece, The Life of the Mind, her most profound reflection on thinking about thinking takes three main questions as points of departure. What are we doing when we do nothing but think? What is it that makes us think? And where do we go when we think? For irons, artworks are not just experienced by the senses. They are things that make us think as you refer to them as thought things. The difference between thought things and other objects is that a former do not lead to knowledge. Thinking and knowing are two different mental activities she explains, while knowledge deals with cognition and ultimately leads to truth, the need to think arises from the inclination to call beyond the limitations of knowledge and is concerned with meaning. To engage in the activity of thinking, one must withdraw from the world's irons in cist into a private space or rather an intimate space where a thinker can be alone with oneself and in dialogue with oneself. I believe that space and the object of that dialogue can be found in Dutch art of the 17th century. The German philosopher Friedrich Higel would have considered courtes still lives and the works of 17th century Dutch painting in general to be thought objects. In his lectures in aesthetics delivered in Berlin in the 1820s, you rise with barely contained enthusiasm about the philosophical dimension of the highly realistic representations of daily life, so typical of Dutch visual culture. For Higel, these little pictures breathed the spirit of freedom that permeated the Dutch Republic, following its heartworm independence from mighty Spain during the 80s war and its liberation from Catholic domination. In the depiction of ordinary things, Higel saw evidence of a nation that had detached itself from its historical course by making contemporary life a subject worthy of representation. Unlike the religious art of southern Europe or allegories glorifying monarchs at the French and English courts which subjected viewers to a particular ideology, Dutch art had freedom itself from such constraints by insisting that people should see the world for themselves. It manifested the spirit of self-consciousness by presenting to its citizens an image of themselves and the life they led, not that there is a description of the world, but rather an object of contemplation. Still life painting in particular had freedom itself from the incumbrances of narrative or religious meaning and could instead present the world as an object of contemplation. Higel is not interested in actual ordinary things because the world is filled with such objects, but in the way their appearance had been captured in painting through the play of light falling onto them as he sees exemplified in the work of Willem Kulf. The lustre of the silver picture, the translucent rumour glass, the sparkles on the glass holder, and the shine of the citrus fruits waxy skin. These reflections of light are for Higel, signs of the fugitive and transitory aspects of lives, constant flux that Kulf has been able to imbue with a sense of permanence precisely for purely contemplative inspection. In painting, Higel writes, we see what is effective and active in ourselves. Kulf's painting not only shows us the play of light reflecting on things but also serves as a ground that pictures the viewer's reflection. In light of the current debates around decolonization and slavery, the celebration of the possession of luxury commodities such as sugar, spices, precious metals, and Chinese porcelain in paintings like these give us pause. We are drawn to consider the cruel exploitation of people in the lens, involved in the production and trade of these products. This line of thought falls outside my presentation today, but it is something that we should always keep in mind. And the quintessential work of Julia Oshtaser on Still Life and Trade, and more recently Claudia Swans book on Rarities of these Lens are fundamental points of reference here. Another category of Still Life takes its function as a site for contemplative inspection even further. In 1634, the Harlem Still Life Painter Willem Heda depicted a tabletop, partly covered with a green cloth. All it stands a large rumor glass filled with white wine that is flanked by a silver tutsa and a gilded beer pitcher, its lid left open. A tool to plate holding two olives is placed at a far left corner. Another search plate in the foreground offers the viewer a slice of lemon freshly cut with a knife. Some crack nuts can be found between these objects, and this is all there is. In this highly realistic image, no room is left for obscurity or ambiguity, but the longer we stay with this painting, the more we realize that the composition has been carved carefully and follows a certain logic. Except for the rumour glass and a knife, all other elements have been arranged as an eco-bearers. Two hazelnuts on the left rhyme with the two olives, but perhaps even more strongly with the two walnuts, there they are again, on the right, accompanied by pieces of their shells as if they wish to display their coats as well as what lies within. The lemon has been subjected to a similar treatment, its full form as well as the process of its dissection revealed in this spiraling peel. The tutsa, traditionally used for pompous presentations, hurlously lays on its sides, its position allowing the viewer to glimpse its unusual unseen bottom. A piece of chain is dangling from its right handle, weekly echoing the suspended lemon peel. It is as if we are seeing things in different modalities, both as entities and as things broken or opened up. Even the tablecloth invite us to ponder, synastatically, the division between the covert and the uncovert portion of the table top to see how the bare surface would feel, how the wine might taste, how the lemon might smell, how our teeth might pierce the skin of the olives. Breakfast pieces are distinctly suitable, not only for the contemplation of objects, but also for establishing a relation between objects and self. Heda evokes our senses profoundly, demonstrating that we look with our entire body rather than merely with our eyes, and perhaps even more intently with the mind than with the body. Does this painting offer us literally food for thought? In the literature and the philosophical writing of the time, the common metaphor used to describe thinking hard was to chew. Constantine Hauhens, secretary of the Prince of Orange, and as well as a diplomat composer and poet, complained about brainless readers who had apparently criticized his poems for being too hard to read. These lazy critics, Hauhens writes in his own defense, would rather read vapid rhymes rocking them to sleep than use their intellects. His poetry was not meant as entertainment he insists, but as exercises for the mind, its value would be revealed only to the patient and benzov reader, for whom his verses were, he writes, akin to full-bodied wine that bites the tongue when tasted or as one writer puts it. Who wants to eat a pit needs to crack the knot. This poem is not written for water drinkers or principal people, but for the alert readers, to whom the secret will be revealed after repeated readings. Anything deluded with the water is disgusting, but what is rich in taste will be munched over carefully one mouthful at the time. Hades breakfast offers us not to crack as well as those already cracked, it gives us wine to taste and lemons to increase the buys of the experience. The connection between chewing and thinking is still apparent in the verb to ruminate, which Oxford English dictionary defines as to turn over repeatedly in the mind to meditate deeply upon. A well-rumination has taken on connotations of obsessive thoughts in the early modern period, its meaning was to muse or to ponder. I suggested breakfast pieces are pen-set images that were used as sites for thinking. The pride of a narrative or symbolic meaning lead us away from interpretation and towards the unknown and to thoughts, not yet thought. They may have offered an opportunity to find a moment of silence and solitude by one's two before them, which would have been especially beneficial for those without a designated thinking space like a study. Indeed, these tables are particularly inviting to an individual viewer, laid as they are for a meal for one. The objects are all life-size, some pushing their plates in the direction of the viewer to emphasize that they are there for the taking. This trend towards an individual intimate mode of looking is also visible in so-called encyclopedic still-life, simulating small art cabinets filled with things, some pushed in the direction of the viewer in Trump-ly fashion. The habit of providing paintings with curtains to protect them from the light reinforces the intimacy of looking as well. Each instance of looking is preceded by drawing back the curtain to reveal the image. A gesture painters like to play with as this double trump-ly of a string of flowers covered by a painted curtain demonstrates. The image of the duchess self-reflexible philosophical people does not align with the account given by the many foreign visitors visiting the Netherlands in the 17th century. Comparing the Republic to their English, French, or German monarchies, they were baffled by the work ethic of these burgers, the citizens' burgers. Their houses were spotlessly clean, the doorknobbs shining like jewels, and their towns were constantly the size of collective building projects, as you see here in the building of the new town hall on the dump square in the heart of Amsterdam. The self-reliance of Dutch women was much commented upon. Unlike their European counter-quart, they were bossy, industrious, entrepreneurial, and able to handle money and conduct commercial transactions in the absence of their husbands. To the astonished eyes of foreign visitors to duchess were like a serious ants crawling around the globe. Yet, René de Carteside had it was precisely the hustle and bustle of Dutch towns that provided him with the best possible location to, I quote, to remove myself from all places where any acquaintance were possible and to retire to a country such as this, Holland, where I can live as solitary and retired as in deserts the most remote. In order to develop a new method for philosophy based on thinking about thinking and the notion that the body serves as a container for the inner self, the cart separated himself from society but did so in the first instance in Amsterdam, the busiest harbor of the 17th century. Thinking is an activity that one usually enjoys alone. The cart was not the only one who managed to find solitude amidst busy life. The need for seclusion was growing, resulting from the rise of Protestantism that recommended that the individual read the Bible and combine with the new philosophy of the cart and others and the influence of humanist writings which insist that study and self-reflection would provide a better grasp of ones in our life. On our ironwood later claim that withdrawal from society and an available refuge of intimacy are crucial to such thinking. The increasing demand for silence and solitude emerges in a novel division of space in the domestic sphere. And over the course of the 17th century a growing number of houses started to include a small space referred to as a bookroom, a comp-twire, a backroom or study. At the start of the century homes of clergymen contain small rooms usually located on the second floor or in an attic or in any case removed from noisy family life as we see here. And by the middle of the century and this is visible in painting such bookrooms had become more widespread. The subject matter of this painting closely follows Montenna's statement that he needed a backroom to be able to retire from family life in order to meditate. The woman is here glorified as the pivot of the households effortlessly balancing the needs of each of the two children while her hands of husband looks on from the privacy of his study. The constrained proportions of the comp-twire guaranteed his solitude. A study was usually quite small, a space built for one and sometimes referred to by its Latin name as a museum. However, this sort of room should not be confused with the art rooms or homescommer than appearing in greater numbers. Because in contrast to these art rooms studies were usually sparsely furnished. A medical man might have a skeleton on the shelf, a naturalist could keep lenses and microscopes in a cupboard but the walls of most studies were lined with books as we see here in a series of portraits of famous scholars situated in fictional spaces. Among the few decorative objects to be found in studies were portraits or little statues of Erasmus globes and I'll show you actually here a pocket globe from the Harvard Library collections. Shells and mirrors instrumental if one were really to know oneself as well as small dull house like objects like this miniature wooden skull in a leather case. It's like this bit. But we also find our small paintings often representing figures absorbed in books or in thoughts situated in a study that very much resembles those in which they were hung, such as this one. This is a very small work that for a long time was thought to have been painted by Rembrandt but is currently attributed to his workshop. That used to be seen as half of a pendant of the same size that is now attributed to Salomon the Coney. Of the many examples I could choose I want to show you this one as it was the subject of much philosophical writing about the century of the upper meridian France. It's in the Louvre. We see an old man sitting at a desk near a window with his hand glass, his head is slightly tilted forward indicative of pensiveness. A large book lays folded open on his desk. Its pages may have inspired the figures deep meditation. On the lower right an elderly woman is spoken in the fire with thongs. While she is actively involved in household activities of heating and cooking, in contrast, the old man engaged in nothing but thinking is the embodiment of the feat a contemplativa. The two figures have been formally separated by a spiral staircase in the shape of the letter S. A household feature so conspicuous that once eyes cannot help ascending its steps and getting halfway lost in its deep, impenetrable obscurity. Visually, the only way the viewer's eyes could continue along this spiral pathway would be to keep climbing the visible steps on the staircase outside. A movement that gives this tiny panel a great sense of space. The juxtaposition of the two figures on either side of the winding stairs eliminated by the two kinds of lights and inhabiting two distinct realms of privacy raises the question not of what the old man is thinking, if any indication the title of the book will never be known, but of where he has gone while he's thinking. The emptiness surrounding him suggests that it is not he who fills the room but rather his thoughts. The chiaroscuro obscuring the room's corners produced to kind of a circular frame of enclosure, turning this interior into a depiction of interiority, a metaphor for mental space. It's not difficult to imagine this painting as a thought object in our own sense. Likely to have hung in a study, it served a function that went beyond the decorative. It was a reflective object in the double sense of the word as an image to reflect and as something mirroring the viewer's own activity. So then we have a situation of a thinker is sitting in a study looking at an image of a thinker in his study. Thus the contwire contains various objects of speculation, books, mirrors and paintings like this, all of which were interrelated. This correlation demonstrates that the activity of thinking involves always a thinking about thinking, which may result from picturing oneself doing it. The pictorial convention I've shown is rooted in a much wider tradition of writers and scholars depicting themselves before descending into their inner selves. In his essays, Montenna regularly refers to the moments when his thinking takes off, whether he is sitting at his desk, planting out of the window or pacing up and down the rooms of his tower. Similarly, in discourse on the method, René Descartes describes how after a long and difficult journey, he finally arrives in a small room in a hotel where, and I quote, where I was completely free to converse with myself about my own thoughts. At another moment in this book, his philosophical treatise turns into an autobiography of sorts when he compares his method of thinking with his way of life, which he wishes to present to the reader as if in a picture. And in the early 20th century, Martin Heidegger would revive the trope. The desire to draw oneself thinking is a trope in Dutch literature as well. In several poems, writers demonstrate that a meditation on the self-involved picturing thoughts. Willem Hotshauk, Fokkenbroch, in his poem Thoughts in my room, portrays himself as being seated in a soundless small room where he finds joy in his solitude and in his books, and where he can let his thoughts float freely, a scene reminiscent of an image like this. In another poem, Fokkenbroch models himself more closely on the conventional figure of melancholy when he writes, as I sit here and smoke my pipe besides the heart. My face reflecting gloom and my looks cussed down to earth and elbow beneath my head, my mind seeks explanation why am I blagues by fate with so much accruation. And these lines match up quite well with the liturgical figure by Peter Koder, who sits at a table laden with books one hand propped under his while he holds a pipe. These various forms of interrelated interiority reach another level in paintings of fictional study rooms, no doubt meant to be hung in such spaces, featuring arrangements of various objects and things that might assist in the mind's exertion. Hanging from the ceiling, we find the ultimate mise anabeem of speculative thought, a spherical mirror that reflects all objects present in the room and sometimes even includes a portrait of its painter. Its round shape is a reference to earthly and celestial globes, visually rhyming with a skull or in this case the head of the classical statues. In its great book of painting, the theorist and painter Gerard Alores compares the mind with such an orb when he writes, for our minds like a cloth bowl hanging in the middle of the room is affected by all the objects that appear before it and preserves an impression of them. And in this painting, the metaphor is extended. The pictorial space is such, stand in for the mind, visualizing the activity through which the human mind is thought to comprehend the world. It is as if the viewer is placed in the house of mirrors where the architecture of the study correlates with the space in painting, which in turn correlates with the mind's interior space, which correlates with the orb's reflection. In my third lecture, I will deal in greater detail with the understanding of thought as in some sense spatial and the process of thinking as a form of spatial travel or dwelling within pictorial space. In my second lecture next week, I will continue to explore refuges of intimacy by looking at how women limited to the so-called private sphere of domesticity, but deprived of a room of their own, were able to find moments of seclusion and self-reflection in art making. In the 17th century, Dr. Public, meditation no longer takes place within the community or a more nasty order but broader could now occur in the privacy of a citizen's home. Dare the thinker, amateur or professional could ruminate over the objects in a study or the still lives on the wall and could discover in these thought objects or dank-building the gems that make them think. Reminiscence of Van Hoechstrathens characterization of the art of painting as a form of pearl fishing in the everyday business of the Dutch Republic and in folk as well the mysterious underwater transformation of Shakespeare's de tempest, Hannah Arons compares Walter Benjamin to a pearl fisher who endeavored to dive into the depths of the past, not to resuscitate it as it had one been, but to realize that, and I quote, the process of decay is at the same time a process of crystallization, that in the depth of the sea into which sinks and is dissolved, but once was alive, some things suffer a sea change and survive in new crystallized forms and shapes that remain immune from the elements as though they waited only for the pearl diver who one day will come down to them and bring them up into the world of the living as thought fragments, as something rich and strange and perhaps even as ever lasting. End of thought. By listening to what pensive images have to say, we, today's viewers, can be pearl fishers as well, diving not to the bottom of the sea, but an earthing gem, the museum galleries, that bring to light pensive images possessed of thought fragments ever rich and strange. Though in the painting, search fragments have been re-found by us and are therefore everlasting. These are the artworks that continue to evoke wonder. Wonder as Plato claims being the only possible beginning of philosophy. Thank you.",
